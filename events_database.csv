See here for details.\nCourse Description\nPolice are often the state institution that we are most likely to interact with regularly, and they are the main institution mandated to provide day-to-day security, one of the most fundamental governance functions. However, while police are responsible for public safety, they can also be an instrument for control and even repression by the state. And, in general, security can be hard to (re)establish, especially after civil war.\nThis seminar therefore focuses on policing in various global contexts, especially post-conflict, and it examines the politics around these security institutions. We will examine what state forces look like during civil war, how the design of state security institutions changes post-conflict, especially with regard to the police, and how these institutions function and potentially contribute to peacebuilding. Post-conflict orders are especially prone to failure. We will also think beyond these states that have had civil conflict to understand questions about policing more broadly.\n The seminar is especially aimed at both the substantive of this topic, as well as the research process, beginning focused study of specific cases. In this course, taking the comparative perspective seriously, all students will develop case studies on how policing structures and controls change at pivotal moments of conflict termination and then how those changes affect outcomes such as citizen trust and cooperation. Students may also choose to code variables about post-conflict state policing, rebel demobilization, and peacekeeper patrolling if they wish for a mixed-method approach. Significant portions of the class will focus on collecting and assembling descriptive evidence in case studies.\nRequirements\nThe Junior Seminars are intense writing seminars which focus on the research area of the faculty member teaching the course. The seminars provide an opportunity for students to have direct intellectual interactions with faculty members while also giving the students an understanding for faculty research.\nSubfield: Either International Relations or Comparative Politics \nPrerequisites\nPolitical Science Majors of Junior and Senior status (must be 3rd or 4th year students with at least 60 units completed) with a minimum overall UC GPA of 3.25.

We want to change this and create a pipeline of creatives from Cal to Hollywood.\nThrough our AAPI Media Creatives Fellowship, BCNM aims to transform both how entertainment careers are viewed by students, and how AAPI are viewed within the entertainment industry. Selected fellows will receive a summer stipend of $1,500 plus mentorship from industry professionals. The funding will help fellows pursue their creative passions in media and entertainment over the summer. This may be through an internship at a Hollywood studio, developing a script or videogame, or auditioning for television and movie roles. Fellows will also receive valuable mentorship from industry leaders Jason Lin (Producer, Story Arch Pictures), Lacy Lew Nguyen Wright (Executive Director, Hillman Grad Foundation), and Laura Reddy (Manager, Range Media Partners), which will include four activities, such as lunches, 1-1 meetings, speaker events and more.\nWe want to build a network of Cal alumni in leadership positions in media who, by developing narratives that feature AAPI and encouraging greater diversity at all levels within studios and agencies, will fundamentally change the ecosystem of cultural production to be more reflective of the AAPI community at large.\nThis year, BCNM has one Fellowship to award. Students will be selected based on their commitment to developing narratives that feature Asian American and Pacific Islanders and encouraging greater diversity at all levels within media.\nApply today.\n8. Reaching out to students to teach for Splash\nSplash at Berkeley is an educational outreach event each semester where high school students come to campus for a day of classes taught by undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs. These classes are between 1 and 3 hours (in hour multiples) and can be taught on literally any (appropriate) topic of your interest. Topics in the past have ranged from black holes to crocheting to poker. Anything you want to teach, you can!

Bridging and Belonging Course from OBI \nWhat if you could get credit for connection? Learn how to build a new kind of community? Challenge the power structures that keep us apart? Enroll now in the course: Bridging and Belonging (Ethnic Studies 198 Group 002) and you'll find out! Trust us, you've never taken a UC Berkeley course like this one! \n\nWe are all meaning-making animals. We build our lives out of stories that are rooted in our connections (our past, our families, our cultures, our experiences). Some of these stories bring us closer to other people, encourage us to invite them in and collaborate with them and others lead us to push away those we consider ‚Äúothers‚Äù. By examining the ways people build these narratives and how we can push them outwards to include ever more people in the circle of human concern, we help to build a future we can all exist in.\n\nIn this course, an offering from the Othering and Belonging Institute‚Äôs Campus Bridging Project, we will work to integrate the core concepts of bridging and belonging (as well as their counterparts of bonding and breaking/othering) into understanding the work being done on Berkeley‚Äôs campus and the possibility of the work to come. The course will offer opportunities for students to develop their own understandings of bridging and belonging, learn about student groups and campus orgs already doing some of this work, and build towards their own implementation and analysis of the course concepts in real-world contexts.\ncourse link: https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-spring-ethstd-198-002-grp-002 \n8.

Fellowship Opportunity at the US Department of the Treasury \nI wanted to reach out regarding the second cohort of the Financial Stability Oversight Council Jr. Fellowship. It is specifically tailored for recent or upcoming graduates of four-year degree programs. I think it could be of interest to your students looking to work in financial or economic policy. \nThe role is a two-year, full-time fellowship program at the Office of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (more information about the role here and the Council here). The Financial Stability Oversight Council brings together federal and state financial and insurance regulators to monitor U.S. financial stability and assess and mitigate potential risks to the financial system, and the Council‚Äôs work is supported by our staff at the Treasury. We‚Äôre looking for students with a background in economics, finance, public policy, or similar fields. They‚Äôd likely be helping conduct policy research on some of our larger policy priorities (which currently include issues such as climate-related financial risk and digital assets), potentially working with financial market data, and helping facilitate some of the operational roles of our team, which puts together FSOC Council and committee meetings and would give fellows exposure to a host of staffers and more senior leaders at various FSOC member agencies.\nThe application materials are listed on the website and are due on December 15, 2023. This would be a great opportunity for students interested in graduate school at a later date (as it‚Äôs only a fixed, two-year term), students who want a taste for federal government work, or just students broadly interested in these policy areas.""]",[None],TRUE,Meeting,29-Nov-2023,03:10 PM,"N340/N344 Chou Hall, Haas School of Business",Not Specified,None

In this talk, we will explore how to think about nested data in causal models, and we will consider the advantages of nested data over aggregate data (such as data means) for causal inference. We show that disaggregating your data---replacing a flat causal model with a hierarchical causal model---can provide new opportunities for identification and estimation. As examples, we will study how to identify and estimate causal effects under unmeasured confounders, interference, and instruments.\nDate and Location: Friday September 29, 2:00pm - 3:00pm PT, 310 Sutardja Dai Hall (Banatao Auditorium)\n9.

The treatments to be covered include cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy among others. This course will give you training in reading primary research articles and review papers. Primary research articles and review papers are a very different reading experience, relative to reading textbooks, so be prepared to stretch and grow! You will also learn how to review the literature and find relevant peer-reviewed papers.

It is the combined session of UGBA127 and MBA296: Financial Reporting and Decision Making for Real Life Success. Anyone who takes classes at UC Berkeley can enroll. It doesn\'t matter if you are a Haas major, a non-Haas major, an undergraduate student, or a graduate student. We are eager to have thoughtful students from a wide variety of backgrounds.\n\nI am Kousha Modanlou, an August 2020 graduate of UC Berkeley and a licensed Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the state of California as of July 2022. I have been helping teach classes at UC Berkeley\'s Haas School of Business since January 2020, when I was just a senior undergraduate.\n\nFor the following four subjects at Berkeley Haas, I have previously served as either the undergraduate student instructor or the assistant instructor:\nFinancial Reporting and Decision Making (Springs of 2020-2023)\nFederal Income Tax Accounting (Summers of 2021-2023 and Spring of 2023)\nAuditing (Summers of 2020-2023)\nIntermediate Financial Accounting I (Summers 2022 and 2023).\nThis upcoming Spring 2024, I will once again be returning as the assistant instructor for ""Financial Reporting and Decision Making for Real Life Success"" offered through the Haas School of Business.\n\nThis course is being taught for only the 5th time in all of UC Berkeley‚Äôs history and you cannot afford to miss it. Taught by an internationally distinguished, award-winning full-time professor, Yaniv Konchitchki, this class provides all the necessary tools, takeaways, and thinking to develop a fully-fledged foundation in financial literacy.\n\nThis enrichment will enhance your ability to pursue countless endeavors in the world of business, whether that be public relations, investment banking, consulting, accounting, finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, human resources, real estate, and beyond. Wherever your aspirations may draw you, we shall help take you.\n\nIn this day and age of enormous uncertainty, it is imperative to find clarity on the road to economic prosperity. To do so involves a robust grasp of the macroeconomy and capital markets, which in many ways begins from understanding how to read, analyze, and make decisions based on corporate financial statements.\n\nWe shall delve into the inner workings of the enterprise and diligently build a fluency that will bolster your confidence when it comes to making investment choices that will ultimately shape your lifestyle, career, retirement, and worldly ambitions.\n\nOver 440 students have resoundingly benefited and passionately attested to the value added to their professional and personal lives after immersing themselves in this offering in the past three spring semesters.

They now also have a modest number of unreserved seats available. Continuing students have until this Friday, June 16th, 11:59PM PT to either enroll into or waitlist CS 61A. At this time, waitlisting is going to be the best way to get into the course in Fall 23. \nIf you are not able to enroll directly into the course, we are also thrilled to announce that students intending to major in Cognitive Science will have 75 seats reserved in the CS 61A-001 lecture. These seats will become available on July 17th, the first day of Phase 2 for continuing students. \nContinuing students who are unable to enroll and would like to be considered for these seats must FIRST add themselves to the CS 61A-001 waitlist and THEN fill out this form no later than Thursday, June 15th at 11:59PM (PT).  Being on the waitlist is how students will access the 75 seats reserved for Cognitive Science intended majors. You are not guaranteed a spot in CS 61A-001 by filling out this form. However, this will ensure that you will be eligible for the Cognitive Science intended major seat reservations during Phase 2.\nIf you are not able to get one of the unreserved seats during Phase 1 and you are not able to get one of the 75 reserved CogSci seats in Phase 2, you may still be able to enroll in CS 61A during the adjustment period (start date: August 14th). At that time the CS department plans to release all seat reservations. This applies for both sections. These seats will go to students who are on the waitlist first, thus your best option is still to waitlist. \nNotes for New Incoming First Years\nIf you are a new incoming freshman, you will not be considered for the reserved seats in CS 61A. New incoming freshmen should prioritize enrolling in a combination of the following:\nMath 1A, Math 10A, or  Math 16A\nStat 2, Stat 20, or Data C8\nPhilos 3, Philos 12A, or Philos 25A\nA reading & composition course\nCogSci 1B\nBreadth requirements not as easily acquired through the major\nPhysical Sciences\nInternational Studies\nHistorical Studies\nArts & Lit\nNotes for New Transfer Students \nIf you would like to be considered for these seats, you must FIRST fill out this form no later than Thursday, June 15th at 11:59PM (PT) THEN add yourself to the CS 61A-001 waitlist when you enrollment appointment begins.

However, this will ensure that you will be eligible for the Cognitive Science intended major seat reservations during Phase 2.\nWe thank everyone for their patience during this stressful time.

The project is designed as a qualitative longitudinal study to provide insight into the strategies, approaches, and mechanisms students use when engaging in tasks that require them to reason, predict, and explain phenomena related to chemical bonding. The project hopes to understand how students develop and use knowledge about chemical bonding as they progress from introductory chemistry through more advanced organic chemistry.\nTwo research aims will be addressed in this project: 1) to investigate the development of general and organic chemistry students‚Äô understanding of bonding, and 2) to explore the interplay between students‚Äô ideas and epistemological beliefs about bonding and bonding models. The project is guided by Coordination Class Theory, which frames cognition as a network of fine-grained knowledge elements that are activated in context by the salient features of a task, activity, or problem. Elements of the individual development plan, including training in research methodology, literature review and proposal writing, mentoring, and teaching are intended to support the PI‚Äôs career goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty member in a chemistry department.\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\nThis award reflects NSF\'s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\'s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\nScholarship Opportunities:\nGreat Minds in STEM Scholarship\nApply by April 30, 2024\nThe GMiS merit-based scholarships range from \n500‚àí5,000.

The project plans to look at students‚Äô understanding of chemical bonding, a core concept in chemistry. The project is designed as a qualitative longitudinal study to provide insight into the strategies, approaches, and mechanisms students use when engaging in tasks that require them to reason, predict, and explain phenomena related to chemical bonding. The project hopes to understand how students develop and use knowledge about chemical bonding as they progress from introductory chemistry through more advanced organic chemistry.\nTwo research aims will be addressed in this project: 1) to investigate the development of general and organic chemistry students‚Äô understanding of bonding, and 2) to explore the interplay between students‚Äô ideas and epistemological beliefs about bonding and bonding models. The project is guided by Coordination Class Theory, which frames cognition as a network of fine-grained knowledge elements that are activated in context by the salient features of a task, activity, or problem. Elements of the individual development plan, including training in research methodology, literature review and proposal writing, mentoring, and teaching are intended to support the PI‚Äôs career goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty member in a chemistry department.\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\nThis award reflects NSF\'s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\'s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\nFung Fellowship:\nThe Fung Fellowship Application for the 2024-25 academic year is now open!

Sleep problems in PD are diverse and can be made worse by medications that treat other PD symptoms by affecting dopamine or norepinephrine levels in the brain. While dopamine- and norepinephrine-releasing neurons (DA and NE neurons) are involved in regulating sleep and are among the first neurons to degenerate in PD, it is unknown if sleep and degeneration have common molecular components. Emerging evidence has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate during steady DA and NE neuron activity and that these neurons are inhibited by elevated ROS. It remains to be determined if ROS levels accumulate during prolonged wakefulness and if sleep helps to recover from the cellular oxidative stress imposed by ROS. The proposed research will employ cutting-edge imaging of DA, NE, and ROS dynamics using fiber photometry, optical stimulation of ROS production, and genetic manipulations in mouse models. This project will advance our understanding of how ROS affect sleep quality and whether sleep is protective against the unabated oxidative stress associated with PD.\nThe project will involve 1) brain sectioning, histology and fluorescent imaging to identify crucial redox enzymes in monoaminergic neurons, 2) constructing EEG/EMG electrodes for sleep recording in mouse models and 3) PCR genotyping to identify mice for experiments 4) analysis of sleep recording data using Matlab (programing experience is not a requirement).\nThe student can start working in the laboratory as soon as they would like (hopefully before June) and continue working with us throughout the summer. At the end of the summer we will discuss whether they would like to join the lab through the URAP program in the fall and spring\nIf interested, please contact Daniel Silverman at dsilverman@berkeley.edu to schedule a brief interview.\nPsych 101 GSI/UGSI Summer Positions Still Available\nDo you love data?

Sleep problems in PD are diverse and can be made worse by medications that treat other PD symptoms by affecting dopamine or norepinephrine levels in the brain. While dopamine- and norepinephrine-releasing neurons (DA and NE neurons) are involved in regulating sleep and are among the first neurons to degenerate in PD, it is unknown if sleep and degeneration have common molecular components. Emerging evidence has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate during steady DA and NE neuron activity and that these neurons are inhibited by elevated ROS. It remains to be determined if ROS levels accumulate during prolonged wakefulness and if sleep helps to recover from the cellular oxidative stress imposed by ROS. The proposed research will employ cutting-edge imaging of DA, NE, and ROS dynamics using fiber photometry, optical stimulation of ROS production, and genetic manipulations in mouse models. This project will advance our understanding of how ROS affect sleep quality and whether sleep is protective against the unabated oxidative stress associated with PD.\nThe project will involve 1) brain sectioning, histology and fluorescent imaging to identify crucial redox enzymes in monoaminergic neurons, 2) constructing EEG/EMG electrodes for sleep recording in mouse models and 3) PCR genotyping to identify mice for experiments 4) analysis of sleep recording data using Matlab (programing experience is not a requirement).\nThe student can start working in the laboratory as soon as they would like (hopefully before June) and continue working with us throughout the summer. At the end of the summer we will discuss whether they would like to join the lab through the URAP program in the fall and spring\nIf interested, please contact Daniel Silverman at dsilverman@berkeley.edu to schedule a brief interview.\nBIM 88V: UC-wide course: Introduction to Research \nOffered fully online to students of any major from any UC.

It is available for non-Haas and Haas majors alike.\nI am Kousha Modanlou, an August 2020 graduate of UC Berkeley and a current senior tax professional with the multinational Big Four firm Deloitte. I graduated with a major in Sociology and minors in Journalism and Education. I became a licensed Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the state of California in July 2022 while I was working for my previous employer Ernst & Young (EY). \nI have previously served as either the undergraduate student instructor or assistant instructor for four subjects offered at the Haas School of Business: Auditing (Summers of 2020-2022), Federal Income Tax Accounting (Summers of 2021-2022), Financial Reporting and Decision Making (Springs of 2020-2022), and Intermediate Financial Accounting I (Summer 2022).\nThis upcoming Spring 2023, I will once again be returning as the assistant instructor for ""Financial Reporting and Decision Making for Real Life Success"" offered through the Haas School of Business.\nOpen to students of all backgrounds -- undergraduate and graduate -- this enrichment will enhance your abilities to pursue countless endeavors in the world of business, whether that be public relations, investment banking, consulting, accounting, finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, human resources, real estate, and beyond. Wherever your aspirations may draw you, we shall help take you.\nIn this day and age of enormous uncertainty, it is imperative to find clarity on the road to economic prosperity.

If anyone here is also anti-yapping, I apologize in advance because I will be yapping in this post. \U0001faf6\nAs this may be my last post before I graduate, I figured that I might as well try and share as much as I can!\nI actually struggled a lot to think of what to write in this blog post because I think of myself as having a very bland & generic personality; I doubt I‚Äôve ever had a single unique experience or thought. Whenever it‚Äôs my turn to write a post, I feel this pressure to try and share something that is unique to me because what else am I here for? If anyone else has seen the subway take tiktok about the ‚Äúcandid girlfriend,‚Äù I feel like that sentiment perfectly encapsulates the pressure to be super interesting and unlike anyone else. However, it‚Äôs the very fact that none of us are completely unique that reminds me that I‚Äôm never truly alone in my worries, doubts, and fears! So, with the hope that my random yapping may help someone feel less isolated, I will be yapping about a few things that have been on my mind recently.\nAs a second semester senior, I am finishing up the last of my required courses and trying to apply for a teaching credential. On top of all of my student teaching hours, classwork, and the credential application, as a senior, I still want to explore the Bay Area and spend time with my friends before I no longer get the chance to. Although I am having a lot of fun, I am also feeling very stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. One thing about me is that, when I have a super important deadline coming up, and/or I‚Äôm feeling super overwhelmed with all of the things that I have to do, I freeze and cannot get anything done. Two nights before I taught my first lesson for my teaching credential application, I was so anxious that my body went into shock and I was shaking all night. Ever since the start of our spring break, I have not been able to make a sizable dent in my laundry list of things to do because it feels like I‚Äôm standing so close to the base of a really tall mountain that I can‚Äôt even see the peak. So, if anyone else is also feeling overwhelmed and extremely anxious about everything coming up, a lot of us are here with you!\nI did also want to share that, if anyone here believes that receiving accommodations may improve their quality of education and have not yet thought about DSP accommodations, it has been so helpful for me these past 3 years and I strongly recommend it. In my sophomore year, I had scheduled an online appointment with CAPS because of my anxiety going out of control during the pandemic, and I was recommended a second session in order to complete a form together to request DSP accommodations. After receiving the appropriate accommodations, it has helped my academic experience here at Cal so much! (It‚Äôs crazy how much better I can focus during exams when my hands aren‚Äôt shaking too much to write legibly!)\nHowever, despite all of my nerves, I am still enjoying myself this semester‚Äîmostly thanks to my friends! Quite a few of my friends have already graduated, so it has been harder to spend time with everyone, but two things that we have started doing now that we‚Äôre long distance are (after being inspired by others online): weekly photo dumps and an email newsletter! For the weekly photo dumps, every Sunday in our group chat, we will each send a compilation of some photos that we‚Äôve taken throughout the week to share with each other a bit of our current lives. Our email newsletters are less frequent because it does require a bit more coordination, but we do compile a newsletter at least for each of our birthdays! For the newsletter, one of us will create a Google Form with random questions and send it out to all of us to respond, and then compile all of our responses and photos into an email. We actually just sent out a birthday newsletter a few days ago, and I can confirm that each one of us has cried (happy tears) reading our birthday newsletters. We‚Äôve also used this to keep each other updated on both the more significant and fleeting aspects of our lives (gossip, drama, family, health, and more)!\nSome other fun things that I've been up to this semester have been: taking sunset walks/jogs with my friends and picking up crafts-related hobbies! Since I now find myself inside a building for 8+ hours a day, I have been trying to take sunset walks/jogs at least twice a week with a friend in order to make sure I spend some time outside. This has also helped me explore a lot of places around Berkeley that I have been meaning to visit! Sometimes we walk up to Northside and look at all of the pretty views & houses around us, or we go down College to explore some restaurants on our bucket list, or we jog to a nearby grocery store to try out some interesting ice cream flavors we found online! I have also started a shared bullet journal with a friend that we try to trade off each month, so that we can share about our lives and yap even when we don't see each other! Another crafts-related hobby that I've recently picked up is making phone charms. Although I'm not very good, it is fun to think about color schemes that remind me of my friends when I'm trying to make one for them. We're also trying to find one day to have a picnic where we all just teach each other how to make different crafts!\nWell, if you‚Äôve read all of this, thank you for somehow bearing all of my yapping!

Maybe the stress and lack of sleep due to staying up studying for exams is to blame, but for whatever reason, I know many tend to feel an increased sense of impostor syndrome around now. So, to lift up our spirits in these trying times, I wanted to talk about the concept of a ‚Äúmath person‚Äù and why I think you shouldn‚Äôt worry about being one.\n Last year, I attended the Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education (RUME) Conference in Nebraska. One of my favorite presentations was a study on how students describe a ‚Äúmath person‚Äù and what causes them to perceive specific peers as math people. One major takeaway from this study was that students tend to view a math person (which is someone who loves math and is very gifted in mathematical ability) as inherently mathematically-minded. Students in the study tended to suggest that people are either born mathematically inclined or not. I did not find this result to be too surprising since I have read a lot about the emphasis on brilliance in mathematics. I have found that people truly believe the ability to be highly successful in math and other mathematical sciences is attributed to some sort of raw talent or mindset you are born with. One student in the study said math people are born ‚Äúleft-brained,‚Äù further emphasizing this idea that math ability is predetermined.\n This misconception about the need for inherent brilliance to be a successful mathematician is obviously harmful because it discourages learners from an early age. It tells students that if you do not succeed initially, you should stop trying. In addition, there has been shown to be a bias against minorities in the field. If you are a woman, ethnic minority, or identify with any other underrepresented minority in math, you probably know firsthand that it is much less likely that people will expect you to be brilliant compared to your peers. The gender and racial disparities in math are tied to this brilliance culture in mathematics.\n Another result from the presentation at RUME that I thought was interesting was the traits students used to identify certain peers as math people. A lot of their identifications were based on how much they perceived their peers speaking in math classes and helping others with math questions. This showed students were much more likely to be viewed as math people if they were more vocal and interactive. I thought this was very important to note as those who are more social and comfortable speaking in class are much more likely to be seen as math people than those who may be quieter or more reserved, even though these personality traits have nothing to do with mathematical abilities. Thus, I want you to question your beliefs about any peers in your math courses that seem more like ‚Äúmath people‚Äù than you. Regardless of how smart or talented some people may appear, I promise they were not born with any of these abilities and there is no reason you cannot achieve the same level of mathematical ability as them. \nIf math is something you love and want to pursue, then you can do it. Struggling and working hard at it does not make you any less of mathematically inclined. If you decide to keep persisting in spite of any discouragement because you love the subject, then you are a math person.\n~ Kaya\nFollow us on Instagram @mathpeeradvising and drop in to our office hours at Evans 947 or via zoom!\nOffice Hours:\nMondays: 12-1 pm (Daniel)1-2 pm (Kaya)\nTuesdays: 2-3 pm (Izzy),\nWednesdays: 2-3 pm (Leo)\nThursdays: 2-3 pm (Audrey)']",[None],TRUE,Meeting,29-Feb-2024,12:00 PM,Evans 947,LIKELY,Not Specified

Before I get into the blog post, we have a new podcast episode out about building equity in math with a guest speaker, Catherine Cannizzo! We also have a rough transcript of the audio!\nI hope everyone‚Äôs last day of instruction has been going well so far! As this semester‚Äôs classes come to an end and we start heading into RRR week, some of us (I know I am) may be feeling a little burned out even though we know we really need to hold on and pull through for this final stretch. So, here are some ideas for how to work on recovering from burnout based on what tends to work for me (and hopefully for some of you, too)!\n1. Reflect on why you‚Äôre feeling burned out so that you can address it.\nAre you feeling burned out from just the sheer exhaustion of nonstop work, or is it because of the pressure and expectation you feel attached to the work that you do? Are you feeling burned out because you feel like you‚Äôre putting in so much time and effort with no visible progress or achievement? Or is it a completely different reason? Depending on why you‚Äôre feeling burned out, there may be different steps you can take to prevent feeling even more burned out as time goes on!\nI know that personally, my burnout tends to stem from either putting too much pressure on myself, or feeling that the time and effort I put into something isn‚Äôt reflected in my progress. When I‚Äôm feeling a lot of pressure, sometimes it helps to just talk about it with my classmates, friends, and/or family (whoever you consider to be your support system); it can be helpful to just share your worries with someone else, but it can also help open the floor for those around you to also share their own worries, and you may learn that you‚Äôre not alone in your struggles! However, sometimes we struggle with being vulnerable with those around us, or we struggle with finding the right words to describe our feelings. Another thing that helps me when I realize that I‚Äôm feeling too much pressure is to recognize and stop myself when I find myself comparing‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs with other people or with a version of myself that I think I should be. I try to not be disappointed in myself when I don‚Äôt finish all the work that I wanted to in one day. By the time that it‚Äôs happened, it‚Äôs already too late to change it, and all that I can do moving forward is start the day anew and try again (maybe with a plan better suited for the current me). Emotional exhaustion is real! I also try to remind myself that there‚Äôs no point in comparing myself because our lives shouldn‚Äôt be a race, and we don‚Äôt need to stick to this mindset of being on a path of consistent, endless growth. We are meant to be people and live our lives the way we want to‚Äînot just to be productive cogs in a machine.\n2. Remind yourself of why you wanted to do this in the first place!\nWhat drew you to this? What made you love this at first? And, if it has gotten to the point where you find yourself burned out beyond just an academic setting, what did you used to love to do as a hobby? What did you used to love about the world? What used to have you in so much awe that you wanted it to be forever etched in your memory? It‚Äôs a lot harder than I‚Äôm making it sound, but try to fall in love with the world around you again by starting with small, specific things.\nFor me, sometimes it‚Äôs recognizing when I‚Äôm going through my day as if I‚Äôm racing through it, and choosing to take a minute to stop and slow down to notice the world around me. Maybe it‚Äôs noticing how full or bright or big the moon looks tonight, or how pretty it is to see the colors of the sunset paint the sky! Maybe it‚Äôs spending time with those you love; taking the time to take care of yourself with a meal you love; playing a game you love; watching a show; closing your eyes and listening to a song that scratches an itch in your brain you didn‚Äôt know you had; going on a drive with the windows down and the music blasting; or so much more!\n3. Take a break.\nBefore you start thinking about how much you need to get done during RRR week, maybe consider giving yourself time to reset. I know that sometimes the thought of taking a break also feels like a chore (especially if you‚Äôre scheduling it in), but now that we have the next 9 days with no instruction, some of us have more opportunities to take a break. Maybe this break comes in the form of an entire day set aside to reset from the rush of classes and work that we‚Äôve been struggling through this past semester, or maybe it comes in the form of setting aside some time every day to rest and relax. And no, eating while doing work is not a break. If you‚Äôre like me and you also feel the strain on your eyes, try to dedicate some time to resting your eyes as well!\nI know all of this is easier to say than do, but I hope that this semester ends on a good note, and good luck on finals!

This summer I was a reader for Math 54 and I graded hws along with taking a CS class. It was a pretty easy job that helped me then this semester get a GSI role for math 1b under Professor Haiman.  I like teaching and it's nice to have a paid job on campus. \nI think the main reason to become a GSI is to have an impact on your community. Teaching someone something and having them say they get it after is a great feeling and leading a discussion section is a good way to build social skills and even learn things yourself. I haven't taken 1B here at Berkeley and each time before discussion I need to make sure I know the content at a level that I can then teach it and answer any questions. Getting a calculus refresher is fun, especially now that my brother in high school is taking it I can help him better. Also, it's interesting to see some of the content they do as sometimes it's similar to upper div content just without justification. In fact, one of the GSIs made a worksheet that loosely used complex analysis (singularities) but presented it in a very 1b level-digestible format. I'm taking 185 and it helped me see a bigger picture application.\nOverall course staff is a great way to be a part of the math community and help people. I encourage everyone to apply.

Stay tuned for the next episode where we will be discussing the experiences of women in math.\nAs this is my first blog post and first semester as a peer advisor, I wanted to share my insights on a fundamental topic that I wish I had known about much earlier in my mathematical journey: what it means to identify as an algebraist vs. an analyst. I learned about the terms ‚Äúalgebraist‚Äù and ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù for the first time as a junior at Berkeley and ever since then I noticed that I hear about these mathematical subcultures seemingly all the time. Thus, I want to go into a brief explanation of these two types of math in order to demystify these foundational categories and give other students some insight into this aspect of math community culture. \nFrom my understanding, algebraists prefer topics related to abstract algebra and broadly tend to focus on operations which have already proven to be valid and effective and attempt to find different contexts in which these operations can be utilized effectively. Algebra encompasses areas of study such as linear algebra, abstract algebra, elementary algebra, and algebraic geometry. Some structures and concepts algebraists focus on are groups, rings, fields, and algebraic equations. \nAnalysts prefer topics related to real analysis and broadly tend to focus on forming mental models of a system from which intuitions can flow which allow valid calculations. Analysis encompasses areas of study such as real analysis, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and functional analysis. Some structures and concepts algebraists focus on are limits, derivatives, integrals, series, and topological spaces.\nHow do I know if I am an analyst or an algebraist?\nAside from the desire to help students learn a bit about their identities in the math world, I was inspired to write on this topic because a friend recently told me about a sure-fire way to tell if someone is an analyst or an algebraist. It all comes down to one question: How do you eat your corn? If you google anything along the lines of algebraists vs. analysts, you will find many references to a 2010 blog post called ‚ÄúAnalysis vs Algebra predicts eating corn?‚Äù which details one mathematician‚Äôs observation at a department lunch in graduate school. Corn on the cob was served at lunch and he observed that everyone in the department was eating the corn in one of two ways. Some were eating the corn in a ‚Äútypewriter‚Äù fashion (eating along the length of the corn in a straight line before moving on to the next row) while the others were eating the corn ‚Äúvertically‚Äù in a spiral before moving on to the next spiral column. All of the algebraists were eating their corn in rows while all of the analysts were eating their corn in spirals. My friend told me about this article and surveyed some math students. So far, this theory seems to hold true so if you would like to quickly find out which label you want to claim, just think back to the last time you had corn on the cob. By the way, if you come to my peer advising office hours, you will get more extremely helpful advice like this. You‚Äôre welcome.\nWho cares?\nI truly think it is perfectly fine to not care at all about this topic. In fact, I encourage you to not overly invest yourself in the mission to find what category you fit into best as there is no need to limit yourself with such labels. Though it can be fun to discover a new aspect of your mathematical identity, know that these labels are not definite or all-encompassing and I encourage you to find love for both algebra and analysis. However, I think figuring out which topics you find more interesting is quite helpful (especially earlier on in your college career) since it can help you figure out which classes you might enjoy more. Notice, of course, that algebra and analysis are mandatory classes on the math major curriculum. This reflects the fact that mathematicians are generally expected to be experts in both fields. However, if and when you decide which area of math you would like to specialize in as well as what math electives you would like to take, finding your broad preference for analysis vs. algebra is a good place to start.\n I also want to emphasize that a major reason I thought this topic was so intriguing when I first learned about it is that I felt like I had been let in on a small secret in the math community culture. A big issue I have with the math community is this habit of gatekeeping so I wanted to work towards combating this by openly sharing the fact that I learned about these categories rather late in my math career and giving a (hopefully) clear and accessible explanation of what it means to identify with these labels.\n-Kaya\nPeer Advisor Office Hours:\nMondays: 1-2pm (Kaya)\nTuesdays: 12-1pm (Audrey), 1-2pm (Daniel)\nWednesdays: 2-3pm (Leo)\nThursdays: 2-3pm (Izzy)']",[None],TRUE,Meeting,23-Oct-2023,01:00 PM,Peer Advisor Office,LIKELY,None

Thank you to everyone who came out! For those who couldn‚Äôt make it, or would like to see the information on the slides once more, here are the slides!\nFollow us on instagram @mathpeeradvising for information on all math peer advising events and general advice for math majors!\nWith midterm season descending upon us, I‚Äôve been having some conflicting feelings regarding my last year in college. I can‚Äôt wait until I graduate and no longer have to go through rolling waves of midterms that extend throughout the entire semester, but at the same time, I find myself hesitant to grow up and graduate. On one hand, I feel so burned out and ready to stop dreading deadlines. But on the other hand, at least the deadlines that we‚Äôre chasing in college are more explicitly defined, and I‚Äôm surrounded by a supportive community that helps me get through all of it. After we graduate, we‚Äôre all going to separate and have to form new friendships without having classes in common as a convenient medium through which to bond. Because of this, I really dug my heels in the ground for this semester and resisted against letting go of college life by getting involved in as much as I could before I no longer had the chance to: that‚Äôs how I ended up applying to become a peer advisor! Even if this may be the last time I get to lay down on the glade enveloped by the warmth of the Berkeley summer sun, dance under the blinding lights on the Zellerbach stage with the music vibrating through my entire body, enjoy a picnic on the grass near West Crescent with pastries from the Berkeley farmer‚Äôs market, admire the fleeting beauty of the cherry blossom petals falling all around campus, stop to look at the view of the bay when I walk past the Campanile, explore the seemingly never-ending sections of the Botanical Gardens, and so much more, maybe at least I can preserve these memories that I will undoubtedly forget eventually by passing my experiences on to those around me. So, without further ado, although it‚Äôs been done so many times before, here are some tips based on my experiences in Berkeley:\n1. Get involved and/or build your own community & support system\nIf I could only offer one piece of advice, I would say to get involved, or build your own community & support system in a way that works for you! When I first became a UC Berkeley student, it was during the pandemic, so I had stayed at home for my entire first year. I honestly didn‚Äôt even feel like a Cal student; I felt so isolated when the extent of my interactions with the UC Berkeley community mainly boiled down to the blue light from my laptop screen (though it was minimal when the professor stopped sharing their screen and became drowned out in a sea of black squares), and the voices of people coming through my earbuds. However, my experience completely changed after a friend suggested that I attend a GEM meeting to see how it was. Once I started getting involved in GEM, I found my own community of friends and the confidence I needed to develop more friendships across campus! I have realized that personally, one of the easiest ways for me to find close friends is by finding a community space that I feel comfortable in and enjoy, and then finding ways to get involved. This realization is partially the reason some of you may know me as your Stat 20 tutor, your Math 151 reader, or even the person who used to spam you with weekly newsletter emails from GEM!\nHowever, the main point is not about arbitrarily signing up to participate in as many organizations possible! Getting involved in these activities is just the way in which I found it easiest to find my own support system‚Äîwhich is what truly helped me feel at home in the Cal community. Classes feel so much more manageable (and sometimes even enjoyable) when I have someone else in the class to talk to, struggle with, ask questions to, and attend office hours with! As someone who gets in her head very frequently and easily, feeling isolated in my struggles in a course is probably one of the most stressful experiences I have had as a student. When I felt like I was the only one who was struggling, I became unable to focus during lectures because all I could think about was how behind and lost I was‚Äîtrapping myself inside a cycle of self-doubt and anxiety that snowballed until either the final is over, or I drop the class. What I hope to hold onto the most is not the proofs that I‚Äôve learned from lecture, but these memories and friendships that I have made. I truly could not have made it through all four years at Berkeley without all the times that I‚Äôve gone to cafes to study and do homework with friends, treated ourselves to some dessert and/or boba after a devastating midterm, and just struggled together & helped each other figure out what we‚Äôre stuck on. Even outside the scope of our classes, just being able to work together to overcome rough moments in our lives and share in our celebrations has truly made me so grateful for my time here.\n2. Fall in love with the small things\nAs it is very easy to feel burned out from all of the constant sea of deadlines, projects, exams, and responsibilities, whenever I find myself dreading the start of each coming day and feeling stuck in this monotonous routine of bleh, I try to remind myself to appreciate the small things that I‚Äôve come to take for granted, and recall why I chose to follow this path in the first place.\nPersonally, I love taking note of the nature around me in order to fall in love with life again. Especially when it feels like my eyes are constantly glued to some sort of electronic screen as a college student, it feels nice to disconnect for even a few seconds to appreciate what is around me. As the weather starts to cool down, I find a sense of serenity in feeling the ripples of the wind across my skin and hearing the rustling of the trees as I walk to class each morning, when the rainy season comes as the leaves start to change color, when the cherry blossoms bloom momentarily and flitter to the ground almost immediately, and when the sun provides some warmth as I lay down on the grass with my earbuds in and close my eyes.\nI have also started a personal Notion page to keep track of cafes that I have visited around Berkeley to commemorate my experiences. It‚Äôs very easy for me to quickly forget how much I enjoyed the avocado toast and iced honey latte from States Coffee, the Thai iced coffee from Royal Ground Coffee, the soup of the day‚Äôs from the Musical Offering Cafe, the black sesame latte from CoRo Coffee Room, and etc. By keeping notes on my first thoughts, I can reminisce in the joy I felt when I first experienced these cafes.\n3. Take the time to learn more about yourself\nTake the time to learn more about what environments you tend to study best in, what tends to drain your energy easily, where and when you need to draw your boundaries for time commitments & friends, what brings you joy, what makes you feel like all of this is worth working for, and anything else you can learn about yourself!\nCollege is a unique period of time in our lives where we enjoy some sense of independence, without being simultaneously bombarded with all of the responsibilities that come with being an adult. With this freedom and capacity to explore as a college student, I have learned so much more about myself that helps better inform how I should plan my days and spend my time so that I don‚Äôt feel too overwhelmed and/or drained at the end of the day. Moreover, taking the time to learn about myself and reflecting on how I can work towards being a version of myself that I am proud of has also helped me grow as a person, friend, and daughter.\nSo, if you ever want to hear more about my experiences here at Berkeley, talk more about cafes & study spots, freak out about upcoming deadlines and exams, ask for some advice regarding Stat 20, Math 151, or any other classes that I am familiar with, feel free to drop by during office hours!\nPeer Advisor Office Hours:\nMondays: 1-2 pm (Kaya)\nTuesdays: 12-1 pm (Audrey), 1-2 pm (Daniel)\nWednesdays: 2-3 pm (Leo)\nThursdays: 2-3 pm (Izzy)']",[None],TRUE,Social,15-Oct-2023,Not Specified,Not Specified,LIKELY,None

To start this semesters‚Äô posts I wanted to talk about something that has been on my mind a lot this year, which is my feelings about being a woman in math. \nThe gender gap in my classes feels far more extreme and evident than my classes last year. Because there are so few women present, I feel that I am unwillingly being made a representative of the gender. Maybe others don‚Äôt see it that way, and this is my self-consciousness speaking, but it seems that if I always notice when one of the very few women in a lecture asks a question, others notice when I do as well. This has also made my already present feelings of imposter syndrome and shyness stronger. I still feel set apart from many of my peers because I‚Äôm a transfer, and now I feel further set apart due to my gender. Consequently, it's hard for me to ask questions in class or to discuss homework with my peers because I‚Äôm afraid to be a poor representative for women in math as a group. If I ask an obvious question or talk about a bad homework grade, people will not only think that I‚Äôm bad at math, but they will think that all women are. I think this might hold, at least in some way, for the other women in my classes as well since often none of us ask questions or participate. \nI‚Äôm sure many people here experience imposter syndrome and feel like they stand out by being a part of an underrepresented group in their major. I‚Äôve been trying to talk about this experience more since I don‚Äôt think I took it seriously enough last year. I‚Äôve always known there was a gender gap in the math department here, but it was close enough in my previous classes that it didn‚Äôt bother me as much and I didn‚Äôt realize how extreme it could get. \nWith this topic in mind, we (the math peer advisors) plan to host a panel on gender equity in November.

For those who couldn't make it, here are the slides. \nWe made a Math Peer Advising instagram! Follow us @mathpeeradvising for information on all math peer advising events and general advice for math majors.\nThis week, as I finish up my first year at Berkeley, I wanted to talk about my experiences as a transfer student so far. These are my unique experiences, but they may resonate with some of you. \nWhen I first came to Berkeley I was very worried about only having two years here before graduating and I was concerned I wouldn‚Äôt be successful in my classes as there was a significant jump in difficulty between community college courses and upper division courses here. Everyone told me Berkeley would be hard and to take my first semester easy, so I took some classes I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in because they seemed easier. While this did make my first semester easier, it also made me feel more behind and like I was wasting my time when I was doing work for a class I didn‚Äôt care about. This semester, I‚Äôm taking mostly upper-division math classes and I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm much more willing to put in the necessary work when I care about the class, and as a result, I‚Äôve been more successful in these classes so far. The first semester at Berkeley can be a shock and I don‚Äôt want to recommend overdoing it to anyone, but I also think that some of us get scared and hold ourselves back. \nAnother fear I had was that I would never get to know any professors or be able to be involved in the math community here. These seemed to me like things I needed to have started freshman year, and that I was coming in too late. As far as getting to know professors, just showing up during office hours does so much, depending on the size of your class. Knowing my professors has vastly improved my experience here as I enjoy going to class more and I‚Äôve become far more comfortable asking for help on the homework or asking for class or reading recommendations. For getting involved in the math community, going to club meetings and talks has been very helpful for me. I was scared to go to any talks last semester because I felt so unqualified to even listen to somebody talk, but once I let go of trying to understand everything I found it much easier. Sometimes I just recognize a few words of a talk, and I‚Äôm okay with that. I think of it as something to be excited about that I might one day understand more and I find it very motivating. \nIn conclusion, what I‚Äôve learned so far at Berkeley is to just put myself out there and pursue what I‚Äôm interested in. I wish I could tell past me to not be so scared of this school and to take advantage of everything I can since I only have two years here. \nPeer Advisor Office Hours:\nMondays: 9:30-10:30 AM (Leo)\nTuesdays: 2-3 PM (Daniel)\nWednesdays: 3-4 PM (Isabella)\nThursdays: 10-11 AM (Sophia), 2-3 PM (Vanessa)""]",[None],TRUE,Meeting,14-Apr-2023,Not Specified,Not Specified,FALSE,None

Follow us @mathpeeradvising for information on all math peer advising events and general advice for math majors.\nNow, let‚Äôs get into the blog post. As a graduating senior, I wanted to use this post to reflect on the lessons I've learned as a math major and a college student in general.\n--\nI‚Äôve always been guilty of failing to appreciate the now‚ÄìI‚Äôve spent a good amount of time in college complaining about all the p-sets I have due and never ending midterm season and waking up for my early classes. But as graduation looms, when I glue myself to a library seat to work on a p-set, I find myself just enjoying the process because it‚Äôs probably going to be one of the last times I‚Äôll ever do this. It‚Äôs crazy how quickly it happened, but soon I won‚Äôt be a math student anymore. In about 5 weeks, many of us will be graduating and starting anew. Maybe it‚Äôs because of how the pandemic dominated our college exp, or maybe I was always going to feel this way, but there‚Äôs still so much I want to do. Throughout this semester, I‚Äôve found myself reflecting on my experiences at Berkeley and thinking about how to make the most of the time I have left. \nBack when I was a freshman admit, a very wise math major imparted on me two pieces of advice that he claimed were the sole ingredients in the recipe for collegiate success. All throughout college, making those two things my priority has guided a lot of my smarter decision-making and now I suppose it‚Äôs my turn to impart them on you:\nGet eight hours of sleep a night.\nGo to office hours. \nIt‚Äôs hard to overstate the importance of sleep in maintaining mental health. On the academic side of well-being, office hours keeps you engaged in courses and as an added bonus is an opportunity to get to know some of the really cool people of the math department. Since the math major requirements are not too extensive, another piece of advice I have is to take some classes just for fun. Classes like intro to astronomy, logic, and history of math didn‚Äôt fulfill any requirements for me, but have had the biggest impacts on how I view the world of math. \nLooking back, I wish I knew not to place too much pressure on myself to know exactly who I was or where I was going. I remember hearing the phrase ‚Äúcollege is the best time of your life‚Äù and feeling inordinate pressure to be having a good time all the time. And throughout much of the transition to college and during the isolation of the pandemic, I felt like a failure for feeling lost and uncertain about myself. It took me a while to learn that the reality is there‚Äôs always going to be highs and lows. To realize that it‚Äôs okay if my college experience didn‚Äôt go the way I expected, or if I‚Äôm still unsure of what I‚Äôm doing with my life. That allowing myself the space to change plans and figure it out is part of the fun. I‚Äôm a different person than I was when I arrived at Berkeley, and I want to celebrate that. If you‚Äôre also graduating, congratulations on what has probably been a pretty wild ride. And whether or not you are graduating, I hope you always remember to take the time to celebrate yourself and your journey so far.\nThanks for reading and feel free to stop by office hours for advice or just to chat :)\nBest,\nSophia\n--\nPeer Advisor Office Hours:\nMondays: 9:30-10:30 AM (Leo)\nTuesdays: 2-3 PM (Daniel)\nWednesdays: 3-4 PM (Isabella)\nThursdays: 10-11 AM (Sophia), 2-3 PM (Vanessa)""]",[None],TRUE,Meeting,11-Apr-2023,05:30 PM,Evans 1015,TRUE,Pizza

This is already my second peer advising post and I thought I would write a mini reflection on our panelist event with Persson, Webb, and Kuan. Firstly, I\'d like to thank all the panelists for joining and making it a fun night filled with pizza and discussion.\nSecondly, I myself have been very indecisive on whether or not I want to go to grad school. My dad did a physics Ph.D. in Italy before moving to the States, so I\'ve always wanted to mimic that. I consistently asked my GSIs throughout the lower divs about whether or not to do a Ph.D. and most of them say something similar. ""You really need to want to do a Ph.D. to do a Ph.D., after all in general it\'s 4+ years of your life.""\nAs of now, Im looking at the year in the industry before I decide whether or not to go to grad school. Currently, I quant jobs and things more in the applied sector are something I hope to get an internship for the summer of junior year. The cool thing about the math major which I remember Persson touching on during the panel is that math is very versatile. People want you in the tech sector, the sciences, etc. You can do a lot with it and if you are unsure about what you want to do after college like me it is a comfortable place to be.\nAnother point Id like to touch on is the difference between research math and the math you learn in say upper div. Rachel Webb mentioned that the transition between undergrad and graduate math wasn\'t difficult but that going from doing math in classes to working on a hard problem for months is a hard transition. She wished that she had been more social and active as it could have made that change easier. I asked my friend who is in a physics lab here at Berkeley and she said that she realized how useless some of the derivations and equations really are and that research is about making approximations and tinkering with people as real-world problems are generally not ""in a vacuum"".\nPh.D. Why or why Not? : (some bullet points from random testimonies Ive read on the internet)\nThe program can take several years, and the work is often challenging, the pressure to succeed is intense.\nResearch in mathematics is often done alone, with long periods of time spent working on complex problems by yourself. If you like working with people a math Ph.D. may not be the best idea.\nIn conclusion, while pursuing a Ph.D. can be rewarding, it is not for everyone. It is important to carefully consider your options, career-wise, and personally before continuing. Remember, there are many other ways to engage with math, outside of a Ph.D. and no one is really forcing you to do it unless they are somehow. Hope this helps someone even though it is very rambly. :D  \nOffice Hours\nLeo Villani: Monday 9:30-10:30 am\nIsabella Arcoleo: Monday 3-4 pm \nDaniel Tsan: Tuesday 2-3 pm\nSophia Xiao: Thursday 10-11 am\nVanessa Li: Thursday 2-3 pm']",[None],TRUE,Social,20-Mar-2023,08:10 AM,Not Specified,TRUE,pizza

For many of us, this is a stressful period of the semester that\'s plagued with midterms (my Math 113 midterm is next week). It can be overwhelming and leave you overly fatigued and stressed to the point where you don\'t even feel anything anymore.\nAs a result of the influx of midterms during this current stretch of the semester, I feel like a lot of students (me included) find themselves trapped indoors. We\'re stuck in our rooms, in libraries, in cafes, or any studying location of our choice for hours on end, staring at our computer screens and textbooks in hopes of understanding everything in time for the midterm.\nSo, today I\'d like to encourage a little bit of (healthy) procrastination and share some beautiful photos of nature. But, these aren\'t any old photos of the outdoors. This is a math blog after all. These photos capture natural occurrences of fractals.\nIf you haven\'t heard of a fractal before, here\'s a bit of context. According to Wolfram MathWorld, a fractal is ""an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales"". In other words, these geometric shapes have patterns that repeat infinitely. Perhaps one of the most famous examples of this is the Mandelbrot set, named after French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who first visualized the set.\nFractals structures with a lot of interesting characteristics to explore. If you are interested, I\'d love to share this video series by 3Blue1Brown on fractals and this video by Numberphile on the Mandelbrot set.\nOkay, that\'s enough background. Onto pretty nature photos!\nFirst up, we have the snowflake. We weren\'t as lucky here in Berkeley, but in other parts of California, the recent storm cycle brought actual snow to cities that haven\'t seen it in years. Note the ""branches"" of the snowflake have their own similar ""branches"".\nNext, we have something that you CAN find in Berkeley: trees (more specifically, tree branches). Similar to above, tree branches have similar patterns at each scale level, creating a beautiful fractal structure.\nOne more photo. If you\'re a fan of broccoli or cauliflower, you\'ve probably heard of Romanesco broccoli. This half-broccoli, half-cauliflower has really fascinating fractal structures in its spiral buds. Another interesting fact about this type of broccoli is that it\'s related to another famous mathematical figure: the Fibonacci sequence  (requires its own blog post). \nIf you made it this far, thank you so much for taking a break from your busy schedule to read my post. I hope this has inspired you to look at nature with a mathematical lens and to perhaps go outside and touch some grass. \nAs always, if you have any math-related questions, feel free to stop by our drop-in office hours!

Many REU programs have pre-determined research topics (e.g. ‚ÄúStatistics and applications in forensic science,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlgebraic curves,‚Äù ‚ÄúGraph theory and Lie theory‚Äù); you write one application per program. Participants work in small groups in conjunction with faculty members and may produce papers at the end of the summer. If you're looking for a more traditional/conventional academic research position, you should start here. REUs are a great route to take if you are looking to apply to Ph.D. programs in the future. Here are some sites to help you with your search.\nMath REU Programs -- a nice comprehensive list of programs which gets updated fairly consistently.\nNSF list of REUs -- the NSF pays for most (but not all) REUs so this is a good source; particularly for new REUs. NSF-funded REUs provide participants with stipends.\nAMS list of REUs -- put together by the American Mathematical Society.\nWhen applying, keep a few things in mind:\nApply to multiple programs. Programs are highly competitive, with hundreds of (highly qualified) students competing for 10-20 slots. \nLetters of recommendation matter‚Äîgive your letter writers an adequate heads up and enough time to write a good letter. \nIf possible, try to get someone with a senior position to write your letters. Like it or not, a letter from a professor takes precedence over a letter from a GSI.\nStart your application early. Postings come out towards the end of the fall semester; applications are due mid-January to early February. Notify your letter writers before the fall semester ends and work on your application over the winter break. \nThere are programs that look for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in math, including ROMUS at Ohio State and MSRI-UP here at Berkeley.\nSome programs accept seniors who will have graduated by the summer they take place. So for those of you in the class of 2024, it is not too late to apply to an REU next semester. From my personal inquiry, the University of Chicago and Ohio State University (ROMUS) programs accept seniors/folks who have not gotten into grad school and the Texas State program accepts seniors with extenuating circumstances.\nOther Research.\nNational laboratories like the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory host post-doctoral researchers and staff researchers who may be open to hosting/mentoring undergraduate research interns over the summer. Many of the researchers work in math-related fields (like graph theory). It is worth noting that most of these programs are paid ($20-$30/hour). \nThere are specific internship programs that you can apply to (such as the Summer Undergraduate Computing Internship at LLNL or one of the applied mathematics internships at LANL), but it is also worth cold-emailing researchers whose work you are interested in. In the latter case, if a researcher agrees to host you for the summer, the laboratory can create a position for you. Here‚Äôs a list of researchers from the Lawrence Livermore‚Äôs Center for Applied Scientific Computing; you can start there and look at some of the papers produced by the researchers. Many of the research projects at LLNL/LANL are student-driven, meaning your research mentor will work to help you accomplish a goal you want to achieve by the end of the program. Like the REUs above, there is a chance that you will produce a paper at the end of this program.\nOther opportunities.\nThe NSA (National Security Agency) offers summer internship programs for statistics and mathematics undergraduates, including the Director‚Äôs Summer Program and the Cryptanalysis and Signals Analysis Summer Program. \nFor more information, I‚Äôll direct you to the Career Center here at Berkeley. It is a great resource to use for your job/internship search. They host career fairs, help with interview prep, and more.\nNote: programs with the NSA and any national laboratory may require security clearances, which can take months to process, so apply as early as possible\n---\nPeer Advisor Office Hours\nMondays: 9:30-10:30 AM (Leo)\nTuesdays: 2-3 PM (Daniel)\nWednesdays: 3-4 PM (Isabella)\nThursdays: 10-11 AM (Sophia), 2-3 PM (Vanessa)""]",[None],TRUE,Meeting,23-Feb-2023,09:30 AM / 10:30 AM,Virtual/Online (specific location not mentioned),FALSE,None

I‚Äôm Sophia, one of your resident math peer advisors. Registration for the summer session is now open, so I thought I‚Äôd answer some common questions math majors may have about enrolling in summer classes at UC Berkeley. \nWhat are the benefits of summer classes?\nTaking summer classes can be helpful if you want to graduate early or need to catch up on classes, especially if you didn‚Äôt do well in a course and want to retake it. The classes are smaller, so you can get to know your professors better. The campus overall is much less crowded, so the atmosphere is more relaxed and peaceful. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean your classes or professors will be more ‚Äúchill,‚Äù which leads us to‚Ä¶ \nHow many classes should I take? What is the workload going to be like?\nSummer classes condense 15 weeks of school into 6 or 8 weeks, depending on the session so the pacing is almost 2-3 times faster than a normal semester. All math classes are offered in the same 8 week long session C. While it‚Äôs definitely doable to take two classes at the same time, the pacing can be overwhelming. At most, you should plan to take half of what you would normally take in a semester. With two technicals, you can basically expect to not do much else that summer since it‚Äôs the equivalent of taking 4 technicals in a normal semester, with even less flexibility in due dates. A common pairing of classes that will give you a more manageable and relaxing summer is a technical and an easier breadth. Pay attention to the hours & workload listed in the catalog when planning your schedule and bear in mind that just because you can take on a certain workload doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Having a stressful summer can cause burn out, especially going straight into the fall semester without a real break. Try to pick a schedule that still allows you the time to enjoy your summer!\nWhich math classes should I take?\nSome math classes lend themselves better to the hypersonic style of the summer session than others. For example, Math W128a with Persson is a very popular and doable math course to take over summer. On the other hand, I generally don‚Äôt recommend taking a core requirement like 104 or 113 over the summer unless you have a lot of time to dedicate to the course. These classes are really important prerequisites for other math classes, and they introduce new topics that can take time to really internalize. \nSo are they worth it?\nTaking summer classes can be a great way to have fun on a beautiful campus while being productive. However, it‚Äôs important to maintain a schedule that allows for good work/life balance and plenty of time to relax. As we all know, the spring and fall semesters can get intense, so over the summer it‚Äôs okay to take on a less intense course workload or take a break from studying altogether and focus on other things that are important to you! \nI hope this is helpful to any of you considering enrolling in summer sessions.

I rarely took notes as there weren't many tests and I was extremely lazy when studying for AP exams. Somehow I ended up at Berkeley anyway (this is a bit facetious) but during the first midterm season, I was punished for my sluggishness. After a rough first couple of midterms, I decided to make some changes to my study habits. I found Tau Beta Pi, and started doing practice exams before tests and would either read the textbook or review my notes if I had them. The second midterms went better and finals even more so. Now as a sophomore, it has become more of a habitual process to find practice tests and read the class notes. \nOne of the best tips I can give is to tailor your studying to the professor. For different math classes, I have had very different methods. Take 110, Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler was an insightful textbook so for each test, I would review all the homework problems and copy down the lemmas to get accustomed to the content. I would only start doing the practice tests one or two days before the exam and then go back and review the concepts I wasn't comfortable with. Writing a cheat sheet even if you can't bring it to the test is very helpful. There was a question on the first 110 midterm that I wouldn't have had the slightest of idea how to do without my cheat sheet.\nOn the other hand, when taking math 54, Professor Paulin's practice exams gave me a comprehensive overview of the content. This class also had 3 discussion sections a week so talking with my GSI on topics I was struggling with made the studying process much faster.\nWhat Im saying boils down to the conclusion that there are many ways to study and that adapting to the class and professor can make things easier and faster.

With that, let's get started with today's blog!\nWith Thanksgiving literally right around the corner, I wanted to take a moment and discuss the things I'm thankful for. \n#1 I have to start off with my family. Without them, I definitely wouldn't be where I am today. Thanks to my family, I found a passion for mathematics from a very early age that still drives my desire to study math at a university level today.\n#2 I'm thankful for math! Math has given me a path in life to follow. It's a beautiful subject that keeps surprising me with everything I learn. While it can be frustrating when I run into a difficult problem, finally solving it brings satisfaction like nothing else. I think a lot of people who love math can agree with me on this point.\n#3 I'm thankful for Leonhard Euler. Why? While many mathematicians have contributed to it over time, it's a known fact that graph theory was introduced by Euler! Graph theory has some sentimental value to me because it was the first math topic I did a research project on (I researched how Google Maps uses graph theory to give you the shortest route to your destination). While graph theory proofs can be a real pain, graph theory's applications are so vast that I'll be able to solve a lot of real-world problems in the future with the help of graph theory. Thanks, Euler!\n#œÄ I'm thankful for pumpkin pie. Man, Thanksgiving dinner is not complete without pumpkin pie, and that's a fact.\n#4 I'm thankful for my friends in math. Shoutout to Andrew! I'm always able to ask my math friends for advice, whether it's about what professor to take a class with or how to word a proof clearly. It's so important to have a network that you can rely on for help! I hope you all can use resources (like peer advisors) in the math department to build your network of friends. \n#5 Finally, I'm thankful for my math peer advisors team! Shoutout to Hanh and all the peer advisors that I work with. They're encouraging, thoughtful, and very knowledgeable in mathematics. I've had a really good time working with them this semester and I hope to work with them on more projects in the future.\nThose are a couple of things I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving. Take some time to think about what you're thankful for, and go and thank them!

While we believe students of all skill levels will benefit from the course, it is primarily targeted at beginners and those with an advanced understanding of the game may already be familiar with most material. The course will focus on 6-max No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem, the most popular variant of Poker played today. We will begin by covering the rules of the game, basic strategic principles, before diving into the mathematics and heuristics used by strong players. While not the focus of the course, we will additionally briefly touch on the psychological aspects of poker, including some common tells and reads found in live play. Disclaimer: At no point during this course will you wager real money. We understand that betting is a sensitive topic for some and you might have issues with the ethical implications, please let us know. We will be focusing on the probability and statistics behind betting.\nAttendance is mandatory (sections meet twice a week for two hours). The majority of one's grade comes from attendance. This year, three sections will be offered: MW 5-7pm @ Hearst Mining 390, TTh 5-7pm @ Moffitt 101, and WF 6:30-8:30pm @ Wurster 102.

We will be following the first four chapters of Emily Riehl's Category Theory in Context.\nThe class is 2 units P/NP, and there will be short-ish weekly homeworks.

This class will be especially useful for students considering taking grad courses like Math 250AB, Math 215AB, or Math 256AB, although anyone is welcome to take it regardless of their intentions to take a graduate class.\nWe will be meeting Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays from 4-5 PM.

Though these words might sound intimidating, we‚Äôll keep things concrete by sticking to dimensions 1 and 2 where we can draw pictures of everything. Only a good understanding of linear algebra should be necessary to enjoy the talk. The main result we‚Äôll explain is how a 2 dimensional TQFT is determined by a single piece of algebraic data. This result led Baez and Dolan to conjecture that the same is true in all dimensions. This is referred to as the cobordism hypothesis; it was recently proven by a number of mathematicians. We‚Äôll give a hint at how the cobordism hypothesis is related to many interesting areas of math. \nBackground: Linear algebra (linear transformations, tensor products, pairings, dual vector spaces, etc.).

I would like to give a taste of its flavor by describing a consequence of the compactness theorem, a basic result in logic. Compactness allows nonstandard analogs e.g. of integers and real numbers. In these nonstandard structures we find infinitely large integers and both infinitely large and infinitesimally small real numbers.\nPrerequisites: No prerequisites are required.

It turns out that it is possible to reconstruct G from just this categorical data but to do this one should take into account the tensor product structure on representations of G, which turns Rep(G) into the so-called tensor category. I will give a brief description of this construction and then proceed to discuss tensor categories without the underlying group. The examples I'm interested in include the category of super vector spaces and Deligne categories Rep(S_t), which give interpolations of the category of representations of the symmetric group S_n to complex values of the parameter n.\nPreliminaries: Math 110, 113. Also some exposure to the language of category theory (doesn't have to be advanced) and to the notion of the tensor product of vector spaces (I'll give a quick definition, but I'm afraid it will be quite difficult to follow if you've never seen this before).""]","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",TRUE,Seminar,18-Mar-2024,05:00 PM,"Evans Hall, Room 1015",LIKELY,Not Specified

Previous work established that heat transport cannot scale faster than 1/3-power of the power supply. Recently, Tobasco & Doering (PRL'17) constructed self-similar two-dimensional steady branching flows, saturating this upper bound up to a logarithmic correction to scaling. We present a construction of three-dimensional 'branching pipe flows'' that eliminates the possibility of this logarithmic correction and for which the corresponding heat transport scales as a clean 1/3-power law in power supply. Our flows resemble previous numerical studies of the three-dimensional wall-to-wall problem by Motoki, Kawahara & Shimizu (JFM'18). However, using an unsteady branching flow construction, it appears that the 1/3 scaling is also optimal in two dimensions. After carefully examining these designs, we extract the underlying physical mechanism that makes the branching flows 'efficient,'' based on which we present a design of mechanical apparatus that, in principle, can achieve the best possible case scenario of heat transfer. We will further discuss some interesting implications of branching flows, for example, anomalous dissipation in turbulent flows and Rayleigh--B'enard convection.""]","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",TRUE,Seminar,11-Mar-2024,05:00 PM,"Evans Hall, Room 891",FALSE,Not Specified

Note that such a statement is obviously false if one replaces `C¬π' by 'smooth', by consideration of curvature. This theorem turned out to be more than a mere curiosity; its proof foreshadowed an important technique called 'convex integration', which found remarkable applications in a wide array of fields, such as symplectic topology, calculus of variations, and fluid dynamics.""]","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0idXRmLTgiPz4NCjwhLS0gR2VuZXJhdG9yOiBBZG9iZSBJbGx1c3RyYXRvciAxNi4wLjQsIFNWRyBFeHBvcnQgUGx1Zy1JbiAuIFNWRyBWZXJzaW9uOiA2LjAwIEJ1aWxkIDApICAtLT4NCjwhRE9DVFlQRSBzdmcgUFVCTElDICItLy9XM0MvL0RURCBTVkcgMS4xLy9FTiIgImh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnL0dyYXBoaWNzL1NWRy8xLjEvRFREL3N2ZzExLmR0ZCI+DQo8c3ZnIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaWQ9IkxheWVyXzEiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgeG1sbnM6eGxpbms9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzE5OTkveGxpbmsiIHg9IjBweCIgeT0iMHB4Ig0KCSB3aWR0aD0iMjRweCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMHB4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjAiIGVuYWJsZS1iYWNrZ3JvdW5kPSJuZXcgMCAwIDI0IDIwIiB4bWw6c3BhY2U9InByZXNlcnZlIj4NCjxnPg0KCTxwYXRoIGZpbGw9Im5vbmUiIHN0cm9rZT0iIzAwMDAwMCIgc3Ryb2tlLW1pdGVybGltaXQ9IjEwIiBkPSJNMjIuOTYzLDE3Ljc3NWMwLDAuNTI2LTAuNDI3LDAuOTUzLTAuOTUzLDAuOTUzSDEuOTE2DQoJCWMtMC41MjYsMC0wLjk1My0wLjQyNy0wLjk1My0wLjk1M1YxLjY4MmMwLTAuNTI2LDAuNDI3LTAuOTUzLDAuOTUzLTAuOTUzSDIyLjAxYzAuNTI2LDAsMC45NTMsMC40MjcsMC45NTMsMC45NTNWMTcuNzc1eiIgdmVjdG9yLWVmZmVjdD0ibm9uLXNjYWxpbmctc3Ryb2tlIi8+Cgk8Zz4NCgkJPGxpbmUgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgc3Ryb2tlPSIjMDAwMDAwIiBzdHJva2UtbWl0ZXJsaW1pdD0iMTAiIHgxPSI5LjIxOCIgeTE9IjcuMTU4IiB4Mj0iMTQuNTI3IiB5Mj0iMTIuNDY3IiB2ZWN0b3ItZWZmZWN0PSJub24tc2NhbGluZy1zdHJva2UiLz4KCQk8bGluZSBmaWxsPSJub25lIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDAwMDAiIHN0cm9rZS1taXRlcmxpbWl0PSIxMCIgeDE9IjkuMjE4IiB5MT0iMTIuNDY3IiB4Mj0iMTQuNTI3IiB5Mj0iNy4xNTgiIHZlY3Rvci1lZmZlY3Q9Im5vbi1zY2FsaW5nLXN0cm9rZSIvPgoJPC9nPg0KPC9nPg0KPC9zdmc+DQo=']",TRUE,Seminar,04-Mar-2024,05:00 PM,"Evans Hall, Room 1015",FALSE,None

The first example one encounters in life are the notions for real-valued functions, where a smooth function is one which is differentiable and a singular one is one which is not. There are also such notions for distributions, D-modules, coherent sheaves, etc. Working microlocally in each of these setting means trying to get a handle on the singularities in question by looking not only at where singularities occur, but also in what direction they arise. In this talk, I will try to give an impression of how the microlocal philosophy is implemented in modern geometry.\nRecommended Prerequisites: Linear algebra and multivariable calculus, but truthfully, the talk is going to be very impressionistic. Most of what I talk about would require a lot of advanced material to fully understand, but I\'ll be sort of hand-waving the whole time. No one who shows up will fully understand the talk, but conversely, anyone who shows up will understand at least the gist of it.']","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",TRUE,Seminar,26-Feb-2024,05:00 PM,"Evans Hall, Room 1015",FALSE,None

The convex hull of all parking functions of length n is an n-dimensional polytope in R^n.

If we consider time as a fourth ‚Äúcoordinate‚Äù, we have four dimensions. These four dimensions are known as ‚Äúspace-time.‚Äù In physics, string theory conjectures that, at scales much smaller than an electron (of a similar order of magnitude of the universe to the atom), there are small strings vibrating. For the theory to work, the strings must vibrate in 6 compact extra dimensions, for a total of 10 dimensions! It turns out that two geometric models for the strings give the same physics. These pairs opened up mathematicians to the notion of ‚Äúmirror symmetry‚Äù which gives us a lot of interesting information about geometric spaces. In this talk, I will define a ‚Äúgeometric space‚Äù, give some examples, and illustrate how to visualize higher dimensions as well as touch on the connection to my research in homological mirror symmetry.']","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",TRUE,Seminar,29-Jan-2024,05:00 PM,"Evans Hall, Room 1015",FALSE,Not Specified

Its constructions tend to be extremely general, and its theorems tend to trivially imply existing results of, for instance, algebra, topology, and/or logic. \n\nAt higher levels of mathematics, the language of Category Theory becomes highly prevalent.

They asked if those machines would one day learn how to think and feel. An easier question they asked was whether they could solve polynomial equations. (The answer, found in 1970, was \'no!\' So machines won\'t replace us.)\nThe second story: The simplest equations (""elliptic curves"") humanity does not understand look deceivingly simple, but have been a riddle for more than a century now. One major piece of light has been shed on this riddle in 1922 using a really simple idea.\nThe third story: Some equations don\'t have formulas for finding x, but this imperfection leads to something new -- we can still \'find\' x by using x to make up new numbers instead.\nIf time permits, I will mention a result from about a decade and a half ago that weaves these three stories together.']",[None],TRUE,Lecture,06-Mar-2023,05:00 PM,Evans 1015,FALSE,None

Content is going to cover the basics, data structures, graph problems, sliding window, string problems, linked lists, dynamic programming (hopefully everything you need to ace the tech interview). \nThe first week is going to cover data structures and relevant leetcode easy problems. Each week will slowly increase difficulty and we will ""assign"" problems to work on over the week on your own to perfect the topic covered in the previous week. It is done entirely in python and it is expected that you are familiar with programming in python already (I.e CS 61A/88/etc) although advanced topics like those found in CS 170 will be taught but from a practical/coding perspective and not so much a theoretical one. Only around 40-45 spots are available so sign up soon. Note that you will have to sign up for each workshop individually, although it is possible that we will give preference first to those who attended the prior workshop. It is open to anyone who would like to improve their Leetcode skills for technical interviews. \nYou can sign up for the first workshop using the link below!

Thank you (: Oh and if you weren't familiar with the class, here's part of the blurb from the course page:\nThe purpose of this course is to teach students poker fundamentals, both to help them improve at the game and learn wider applications of the game theory found in poker. While we believe students of all skill levels will benefit from the course, it is primarily targeted at beginners and those with an advanced understanding of the game may already be familiar with most material. The course will focus on 6-max No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem, the most popular variant of Poker played today. We will begin by covering the rules of the game, basic strategic principles, before diving into the mathematics and heuristics used by strong players. While not the focus of the course, we will additionally briefly touch on the psychological aspects of poker, including some common tells and reads found in live play.\nDisclaimer: At no point during this course will you wager real money. We understand that betting is a sensitive topic for some and you might have issues with the ethical implications, please let us know.

The MegaVanderTest is the test that achieved the largest concentration of self-driving vehicles collaboratively controlling traffic on a single stretch of freeway in the history of self-driving vehicles. The talk will first cover the architecture built and deployed by the CIRCLES team. It will present some of the algorithms populating the planning layer of the system, mostly based on optimal control and imitation learning of Kernel-based expert controllers. It will also present some of the algorithms populating the local control regulation layer, based on deep-reinforcement learning and MPC. Finally it will present the way the algorithms had to run in the field, due to the fact that most modern ACC architectures do not always open access to all sensed quantities collected by onboard instrumentation.\n\nBiography\nAlexandre Bayen is director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute, associate provost for the Berkeley Space Center, and Liao-Cho Innovation Endowed Chair and professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences and of civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley. He received an Engineering Degree in applied mathematics from the Ecole Polytechnique, France, in 1998, and an M.S. and Ph.D. in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University in 1999 and 2004, respectively. He was a Visiting Researcher at NASA Ames Research Center from 2000 to 2003. Between January 2004 and December 2004, he worked as the Research Director of the Autonomous Navigation Laboratory at the Laboratoire de Recherches Balistiques et Aerodynamiques, (Ministere de la Defense, Vernon, France), where he holds the rank of Major.']",[None],TRUE,Lecture,11-Sep-2024,04:00 PM,306 Soda Hall (HP Auditorium),TRUE,Light
