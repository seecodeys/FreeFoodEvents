Optimal mechanisms in such multi-dimensional screening problems are known to in general be complicated and not resemble mechanisms observed in practice. Thus, we instead analyze the optimal convergence rate of the seller\'s revenue to the first-best revenue as the amount of data grows large. Our main result provides a rationale for a simple and widely used class of mechanisms---(pure) bundling---by showing that these mechanisms allow the seller to achieve the optimal convergence rate. In contrast, we find that another simple class of mechanisms---separate sales---yields a suboptimal convergence rate to the first-best and thus is outperformed by bundling whenever the seller has sufficiently precise information about consumers.\nBio: \nRyota Iijima is an Associate Professor of Economics at Yale University. His research is in microeconomic theory, in particular decision theory and information economics. He holds a PhD from Harvard University and a BA and MA from the University of Tokyo. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Cowles Foundation from 2016-17 and is a recipient of a 2024 Sloan Research Fellowship.\nCLIMB Evergreen Seminars\nThe CLIMB Evergreen Seminars are organized by the Center for the Theoretical Foundations of Learning, Inference, Information, Intelligence, Mathematics and Microeconomics at Berkeley (CLIMB), and are generously supported by FODSI (Foundations of Data Science Institute). CLIMB was established to address new conceptual and mathematical challenges arising at the interface between technology, science, and society. CLIMB recognizes the emergence of a new generation of technology that focuses on data, inferences, and decisions, a development that is leading to a deeper engagement between technology and real-world phenomena that involve human decisions, values, discoveries, and culture. \nAccessibility\nIf you require an accommodation for effective communication or information about campus mobility access features in order to fully participate in this event, please contact us with as much advance notice as possible by emailing climb@berkeley.edu\nWe invite you to the upcoming CLIMB Evergreen talks:\nFri April 5 at 11am- Pradeep Ravikumar\nFri April 12 at 2pm- Martin Wainwright\n7.

Guest Lecture: Tipping Points for Global Economic and Ecological Transformation\nNovember 7, 2023 5 - 7 p.m at David Brower Center \nSponsor(s): German Historical Institute Washington, Pacific Office, Institute of European Studies, Clausen Center for International Business and Policy, Haas Center for Responsible Business\nThree fundamental transformations are currently occurring within the global community and within every nation that belongs to it. Across the globe, governments, organizations, and citizens are contending with a shift in global economic interdependencies, responding to new challenges brought about by rapid developments in digital technology, and grappling with the ecological transformations that are urgently needed to slow the pace of climate change. These transformations, unfortunately, often result in greater social polarization and increased division. Presently, the single biggest obstacle to meeting our current global challenges is the failure of societies to create widespread social consensus around certain necessary changes. This lecture addresses how social tipping points can create the self-enforcing dynamics needed to institute global economic and ecological transformation.\nMarcel Fratzscher is a researcher, author, and columnist on economic and sociopolitical topics. He leads the German Institute for Economic Research and teaches macroeconomics at Humboldt University in Berlin. He is a member of various expert committees, including the United Nations High-Level Advisory Board on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Advisory Board of the German Federal Ministry of Economics, and the Board of Trustees of the Hertie School of Governance. His work focuses on macroeconomics and financial markets, inequality, and the globalization and integration of Europe. His opinion pieces frequently appear in German and international newspapers and media outlets such as the Financial Times and Project Syndicate. His 2022 book Geld oder Leben—Wie unser irrationales Verhältnis zum Geld unsere Gesellschaft spaltet(Money or Life—How Our Irrational Relationship to Money Divides Our Society) dispels long-standing myths about our dealings with money—with saving, debt, inflation, and interest—and analyzes what financial risk, provision, and wealth creation might look like in the future.\nThe lecture is funded by the ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius, one of Germany’s leading private foundations.\nSpeaker: Marcel Fratzscher, President, German Institute for Economic Research\nModerator: Katerina Linos, Irving G. and Eleanor D. Tragen Professor of Law Co-Faculty Director, Miller Institute for Global Challenges and the Law, Berkeley Law\n2.

With enrollment week approaching, please read below to be aware of the current adjustments. \n-\nData Science C8:\nYou may notice that many of our Fall 2023 classes are listed with lower capacities than usual. These numbers are not final. We expect that some of our classes will expand in the future, but the timeline for this is not yet determined.\nSome classes will not expand, and most classes will not be as large in Fall 2023 as they have been in past semesters. In particular, we expect that some interested students may not be able to enroll in Data C8.\nWe are expecting to begin enrollment next week with reserved seats only for F23 newly admitted students, and L&S Undeclared sophomores. Our advice to all other students will be to add to the waitlist for now, ideally as a Swap after selecting an alternate class if possible.\nWe are trying very hard to expand the class but it may depend on some factors that we won't know for a little while. We will contact all students on the Data C8 waitlist as soon as an update is available.\nNew information will be posted as soon as available on Data 001 Ed - students and advisors are welcome to follow us there for the latest updates.\nAdvice for all students:\nUse the Swap option to prioritize a non-Data class with unreserved seats in Phase 1 if they are not eligible for the reserved seats in their preferred Data class.\nDo not assume that past enrollment histories or trends will be predictive for Fall 2023. Do not assume that any waitlisted position means that a student is likely to be admitted to a class.\nFor further clarification, the Data Science Advising Division have compiled this list of FAQs that students may want to refer to. \n-\nPsych 1, 101 and Upper Division Tier II/III Psych Courses:\nThere have been substantial revisions to the enrollment guidelines and recommended strategies for Psych 1, 101, and upper division Tier II and III classes; effective this enrollment season for Fall 2023 classes. This means that the changes apply when you begin Phase I enrollment within the next couple of weeks.\nHighlights of the changes:\nThere will not be a waitlist for the above-mentioned classes in Phase I.\nIn Phase I, enrollment is restricted to officially declared Psychology majors.\nStudents who are not declared in Psychology, including those who in the process of completing prerequisites, are limited to enrollment in Phase II.\nIn Phase II, enrollment is open to all students, additional seats will be added, including a small waitlist.\nIn adjustment period, last remaining seats will be added to move waitlisted students into classes. Any students with time conflicts, holds, or at their unit cap will remain on the waitlist\nPlease take a thorough look at our enrollment & course information on the department website. If you have any specific questions after reading through the website, please submit your question(s) here. The Psych SSO Team will compile the submitted questions and prepare an FAQ to share with you.\n-\nComputer Science Upper Division Classes:\nCS upper division classes are reserved for a select group of majors. CogSci only majors do not have reserved seats. Non-majors can get into CS upper divisions during summer sessions where there are no seat reservations.\nPlease review this document for further information: Getting Into Computer Science Classes""]",[None],FALSE,None,14-Apr-2023,Not Applicable,Not Specified,FALSE,None

Our goal is to provide Cal undergraduates the transformative opportunity to dive deeply into their writing process with an experienced peer.\nWe want to remind you that we offer multiple formats of service so students can choose what is right for them. Our Drop-in service is our most flexible service–students can come by anytime we are open for a 30-minute session, and they can always sign in again if they want to continue the conversation. 50-minute Appointments can be booked in advance, so students can plan ahead. In either format, students can talk with a tutor at any stage of their writing process.\nAdditionally, if students have a lot of writing throughout the semester, our Weekly service allows them to build consistency into their writing process by meeting with a tutor on a weekly basis. Through these longer-term partnerships, students can bolster their academic writing process, plan effectively as they navigate multiple or major assignments, and cultivate habits that support their long-term writing goals.\nPostdoctoral Fellowship: STEMEdIPRF: The Longitudinal Development of Students' Cognitive and EpiSTEMological Knowledge about Bonding Models\nApply by April 21, 2024\nThe proposed project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate student learning in chemistry. The project plans to look at students’ understanding of chemical bonding, a core concept in chemistry. The project is designed as a qualitative longitudinal study to provide insight into the strategies, approaches, and mechanisms students use when engaging in tasks that require them to reason, predict, and explain phenomena related to chemical bonding. The project hopes to understand how students develop and use knowledge about chemical bonding as they progress from introductory chemistry through more advanced organic chemistry.\nTwo research aims will be addressed in this project: 1) to investigate the development of general and organic chemistry students’ understanding of bonding, and 2) to explore the interplay between students’ ideas and epistemological beliefs about bonding and bonding models. The project is guided by Coordination Class Theory, which frames cognition as a network of fine-grained knowledge elements that are activated in context by the salient features of a task, activity, or problem. Elements of the individual development plan, including training in research methodology, literature review and proposal writing, mentoring, and teaching are intended to support the PI’s career goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty member in a chemistry department.\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\nScholarship Opportunities:\nThe Jengyee Prize \nBerkeley IEOR is delighted to announce that applications are now open for the Jengyee Prize -- Leadership for a Better World.

For a complete list of responsibilities and requirements for each individual project, please consult the listing on Berkeley Discovery Hub. \nSubmit your application here: https://forms.gle/DmkQsCGmxGXFQfKU8. Please select one of the following projects to apply to in our google form.\nAngjoo Kanazawa: Improving Accessibility for Causal 3D Capture (Kanazawa AI Lab): This student will work to integrate nerfstudio, an open source project that was partially funded by Bakar Fellows program, with the hugging face platform, which will enable people without GPUs to run nerfstudio. This is a high impact project because it will enable students and hobbyists who are currently blocked by compute needs. This will positively impact teaching as well, since now students will be able to use it in our computer vision course.\nKaimin Jia: Molecular Interaction Detector In Vivo - A Platform for Natural Product Drug Candidate and Target Discovery (Wenjun Zhang Lab): Natural products (NPs) have historically been the major source of medicines due to their incredible structure diversity and unique bioactivity. To address the challenges in NP-based drug discovery and development, we propose a new NP-Protein interaction detector that can be applied to screen NP and target protein candidates in vitro or in vivo. This technique utilizes a Split-GFP based method which has been widely used in studying protein-protein interactions and we will evolve this technology to monitor NP-protein binding in our new detector in yeast. Their new molecular interaction detector will enable the discovery of new NP drug candidates, expanding the potential drugs pools for pharmaceutical companies.\nSeung-Rok Kim: Elucidating skin structure using optical coherence tomography for electrical model of skin (Ali Javey Lab): Human skin is the outermost barrier that protects the body from pathogens. The inside of the body can directly mass transfer to the environment through the skin by breathing and secreting sweat. Sweat can moisturize the epidermis and change its electrical properties. However, there are individual differences depending on skin structure such as density and thickness. In this project, we’ll try to understand the electrical characteristics of the skin by identifying the skin structure using optical coherence tomography. By capturing cross-sectional images of the skin, we can relate the impact of each layer on its electrical properties.\nCarla Bassil: Gas Sensing of Human Skin (Ali Javey Lab): It is well established that human skin constantly emits odors which vary with health or environmental conditions. In fact, canines have been trained to detect the changes in skin volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of epileptic and cancer patients. While a powerful tool for health monitoring, skin gas detection remains a largely untouched area due to the hundreds of different gases present at once. With recent advances in machine learning, ‘training’ an array of gas sensors to output a wholistic ‘gas fingerprint’ becomes a possibility. Challenges remain in functionalizing carbon nanotube based field effect transistors to create selective gas detectors, particularly in the presence of humidity. Further, another obstacle involves transitioning the silicon-based device to a flexible and wearable sensor. \nNoelle Davis: Electrochemical device fabrication for wearable sweat sensors (Ali Javey Lab): We are developing fully integrated wearable sensing systems to measure sweat analyte and secretion rate profiles of human subjects in order to assess their physiological status and diagnose or monitor disease. Ions and metabolites in sweat can be used to monitor hydration and other balances. Sweat rate alone can be informative as a way to gauge hydration, stress, nerve damage, and other physiological conditions. We use high throughput fabrication methods to produce these devices in order to support sweat analysis over large-scale population studies to decode what sweat composition and rate signify about health and fitness.\nPsych 199 Research Assistant Positions Now Available!\nThe Psych Student Services office (SSO) is excited to announce the Psych 199 research assistant positions that are available for Spring 2024.

In their treatment, it is history working horizontally, in broad strokes, stopping here and there to touch a human being. Juxtaposition gives us weeping women filling in mass graves; dead bodies in a gorgeous landscape of sunflowers and lowering skies; the parade of people on the land crossing the endless procession of soldiers; farmers walking by the open grave of a dead peasant; battles, bombs, and planes and a man’s shirt hanging from a tree; a screaming skeleton; a lake full of swans.\nContact Info: bampfa@berkeley.edu\nAccess Coordinator: AJ Fox, afox@berkeley.edu, 5106420365\nFarmers Market at South Berkeley: \n July 25, 2023 from 2 p.m to 6:30 p.m | 63rd St & Adeline St, Berkeley, CA | Event Link\nThe Ecology Center Farmers’ Markets are open-air marketplaces where California farmers bring fresh, locally-grown produce and farm-processed foods to sell directly to consumers.

Instead of essentially remaking an earlier film and deeming it a sequel, the creative team, led by director John Lasseter, delves deeper into their characters while retaining the fun spirit of the original film” (Kirk Honeycutt, Hollywood Reporter).\nContact Info: bampfa@berkeley.edu\nAccess Coordinator: AJ Fox, afox@berkeley.edu, 5106420365\nL&S Student Support & Advocacy\nThe College of Letters & Science is committed to helping provide a safe and supportive environment for all students at UC Berkeley, free of bias, harassment, violence, and discrimination.

William Kentridge’s multilayered production stars charismatic soprano Marlis Petersen in the title role—the enigmatic and alluring woman who is equal parts femme fatale, innocent girl, and abused victim. “Kentridge stands out in the world of theater projection, largely because he hand draws so many of his projections with variety, freshness, and genius. . . . Most of the projections in Lulu use Kentridge’s drawings done in German Expressionist style. Like Picasso and Matisse, Kentridge can knock off drawings in a variety of styles with an amazing facility” (Ann McCoy, Brooklyn Rail).\nEvent Link: https://bampfa.org/event/lulu\nEvent contact: bampfapress@berkeley.edu, 510-642-0365\nAccess Coordinator: Christian Bumala, cbumala@berkeley.edu, 510-642-0808\nSick Plant Clinic:\nWorkshop | April 1st, 2023 | The first Saturday of the month every month | 9-11:30 a.m. | UC Botanical Garden\nThe Garden supports our community of gardeners with a free monthly Sick Plant Clinic.

My name is Anishi (she/her) and I’m a third year majoring in Cognitive Science and Data Science. I’m a news reporter with The Daily Cal, Marketing Chair at Asha for Education, and a Research Assistant with the Coleman Research Lab on data privacy. I also work as an English tutor and am involved with CSSA and the Basic Needs Center’s CalFresh team. I’m interested in UI/UX and UX research, so please reach out if you’d like to chat! My recommendation for your Berkeley bucket list: visit the Ferry Building Farmers Market in SF on Saturday mornings (the F bus takes you super close!).\nKavya: Hi! My name is Kavya Marrapu (she/her/hers) and I am a fourth year Cognitive Science and Data Science major. I came in as a Cognitive Science major who wanted to be premed. However, after taking my first data science and computer science class I knew premed wasn’t for me and data and computer science was truly my passion. I decided to become both a Cognitive Science and Data Science major because I love how interdisciplinary both majors are. I specifically love how Cognitive Science lets me explore all my interests, instead of just a single interest. My favorite classes so far are Psychology of Sleep (Psychology 133) and Urban Data Analytics (CYPLAN 101). On campus, I am an officer in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and in the Cognitive Science Student Association (CSSA). CSSA has given me the opportunity to not only meet some amazing fellow Cognitive Science majors, but through planning our yearly conference and other events I have worked with various Cognitive Science faculty around the nation! I also work at the Basic Needs Center as a Data Lead where I manage their data system. Over the summer, I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern for a couple tech companies. Outside of campus, I love to hang out with my friends, get boba or iced coffee, bake, and run half marathons. Feel free to hit me up about Cognitive Science/Data Science, computer science internships, baking, running or anything at all. \nNicole: Hi, I’m Nicole (She/Her)! I’m a fourth year pursuing majors in Cognitive Science, Psychology, and Public Health along with a minor in Education. Cognitive Science was the first major I declared given its combination of my interests in neuroscience, understanding the brain, AI, and learning how to code! I’m also very passionate about mental health and clinical psychology, which led me to pursue additional majors in Psychology and Public Health. Combining my majors and passions, I am currently a Fung Fellow under the Health + Tech Track. On campus, I have pursued research experiences in a neuroscience lab and through URAP (Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program). I enjoy supporting incoming students as a current Senior Resident Assistant (SRA) and former RA for the STEM Excellence through Equity & Diversity (SEED) Scholars Honors Program, where I planned programs and presentations to support incoming freshmen during their first summer of taking classes at Cal. I also spent my past two summers interning at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where I worked on projects related to Science Strategies and Advisory Committees. In my free time, I love hiking, going to concerts, binge-watching Netflix, playing board games, and trying new types of food; feel free to reach out to chat about different cafes/study spots, classes, double/triple majoring, research, or anything at all! (: \nRuishi: Hello hello! My name is Ruisi (she/her/hers pronouns). I\'m a 4th year Cognitive Science major with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy. I first came to Cal as an undecided major, and after taking classes from 9 disciplines in my freshman year, I discovered my passion for brain, coding and philosophical readings and therefore created such a combination of major and minor to fit all the classes I want to take in my 4-year plan. In regards to extracurriculars at Berkeley, I was one of the lead organizers of CS Kickstart, a weeklong Computer Science introductory program for incoming female-identifying freshmen. I\'m also doing brain stimulation research at the Cognition and Action Lab under professor Richard Ivry. Career-wise, I have internship experience in product management and venture capital. I also spent my past summer doing an academic internship at Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo. Overall, I believe college is the time for exploration. I have benefited a lot from this interdisciplinary education and strongly encourage you to do so as well (please let me know if you have any questions!). In my spare time, I like to hike, play golf and sudoku. I believe every Cal student should visit Berkeley Botanic Garden at least once before they graduate (it\'s a beautiful beautiful place!). I\'m really excited to be part of cogsci advising and hope you all have a great semester!\nSophia: Hello! My name is Sophia and I am a senior majoring in Cognitive Science and Business, with a minor in Data Science. I originally came to Berkeley and wanted to pursue Business and Biology, then Business and Economics, then Business and Public Health, then Business and Data Science and then spring of sophomore year I found that Cognitive Science fit all of my interests. Cognitive Science was the perfect blend of the sciences and social sciences, and I was able to combine my interests in biology, data science, and psychology. My favorite CogSci classes so far have been CogSci 190T (Neuropsychology of Happiness) with Davina Chan, Psych 160 (Social Psychology) with Sara Gorchoff, and Data C100 (Principles & Techniques of Data Science) with Josh Hug & Lisa Yan. My career interests include consulting, especially how consumer psychology affects business, and I plan to pursue a career in consulting post-graduation for a few years and then go onto graduate school. On campus, I have been involved in Data C8 on course staff as an Academic Intern, worked at the Study Abroad Office, as well as being a member of a sorority and a consulting club. Off campus, I enjoy hiking, exploring San Francisco, and finding new restaurants to eat. A fun fact about me is that I studied abroad in London, and I traveled to nine different countries around Europe when I was there! Feel free to ask about Cognitive Science, major planning as a double major, summer classes, or anything else that comes up!\nOpportunities\nL&S Student Support & Advocacy\nThe College of Letters & Science is committed to helping provide a safe and supportive environment for all students at UC Berkeley, free of bias, harassment, violence, and discrimination.

Entering Cal, I planned on pursuing a PhD in Math and maybe dabbling in some Physics classes. In fact I was so enthusiastic that I bought a “Physics @ Cal” shirt before even attending my first 5A lecture. I was ready to absorb all the physics info I could. However, just one semester later, I gave the shirt to my brother and haven't looked back at physics since.\nI stuck with the Math major, but as I started running out of classes to take I faced another crossroads: should I enroll in graduate math classes or try something completely different? I decided to give Data Science a shot and also revisit Computer Science, despite not enjoying CS 61A initially. To my surprise, after taking CS 61B, I discovered the joy of working on projects and realized that not all CS content was as daunting as 61A had seemed.  I ended up jumping from intending on doubling in Data Science to doubling in CS. Im now even taking a Statistics class, which I’m considering taking more of.\nThe key takeaway from my college experience is that it’s not about loading up on courses to earn perfect grades every semester. It’s about discovering what you like and what you don’t, and building a support network of friends to lean on when needed. My parents may not recall every detail from their classes, but the friendships they made and the work ethic they developed still play a significant role in their lives today.\nSo, if you're unsure about the math major or any major, or more generally questioning your decisions, I encourage you to go and experience different things. Then pursue what truly interests you, and who knows, you might find your passion/major where you’d least expect it\n-Leo""]","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",FALSE,Not Applicable,17-Apr-2024,09:52 PM,Not Specified,FALSE,None

As we enter spring break I wanted to share some of my feelings and advice as a second semester senior. I personally had my last midterm ever yesterday, and I went about studying for this midterm very differently than how I studied last year or even last semester. I still did many of the things I’ve done for previous midterms, re-read my notes, re-read parts of the textbook, and took practice exams, but all of these things took me a lot less time and I was a lot more confident in myself as I studied. The difference is that this semester I’m taking two classes - which I’ve never done before. I really wanted to enjoy this semester and experience the parts of Cal and the undergrad experience that I felt I had been neglecting. As a result, it was a lot easier for me to learn the material for this class by just paying attention in class and doing the homework. This semester I don’t feel like my brain will collapse on itself because the amount of definitions and theorems and the amount of time I spend on each problem set is too much for me to handle. \nApart from my classes, I’ve had a very wonderful time just existing on campus and in Berkeley so far this semester. I’ve read books for enjoyment, sat on the glade, explored the city, worked in libraries I’d never been in before, and spent valuable time with my friends. I’m often in a good mood, with the energy to have fun and enjoy the day. I personally had a very hard semester in the fall, and I knew it would be like that when I signed up for classes. I don’t regret my decisions, but I got so used to being tired, having to sit in stacks for hours each day, to weekends being reserved just for work, that I almost forgot all the other things I enjoy about life and this school. \nWhile this isn’t my most academic semester, I’ve learned a lot about myself and things outside of my major. Sometimes it can feel a lot easier to focus entirely on school, or life can get too hard to focus on school at all. Either way, it’s important to be kind to yourself and take the time to do things you enjoy. Spring break is a great chance for all of us to reflect on how the semester and year are going. I hope those of you who are also graduating this semester have a chance to step away from academics and enjoy the end of your undergrad experience.

We have finally reached the height of the spring semester, right at the halfway point. I hope you are all holding up well during this very busy time. I recently fell ill (I\'m better now), and it made me realize how stressful and overwhelming this time of the semester can be. In the scramble to meet deadlines, attend meetings, and prepare for exams, we easily forget to do the essential things (eating at normal hours of the day, sleeping more than 8 hours, and touching grass). Despite your chaotic schedules, I hope you all put your health first and take care of yourselves. \nWith that quick PSA out of the way, I\'d like to introduce my blog topic for this week: coding! If you don\'t already know, I am a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. Programming is an essential tool for me and it\'s something that I use on the daily for school, research, and work. Now, some of you are probably asking, ""Well, my major(s) doesn\'t require me to do nearly as much programming, why should I have to know how to code?"" My objective for this week\'s blog is to break down this question and explain why I think everyone should know how to code, especially if you\'re a math major.\nThinking Algorithmically\nOkay, what even is an algorithm? We\'ve all come across the word before and I\'m sure many of you use algorithms in your classes (Euclid\'s, Dijkstra\'s, Gram Schmidt, etc). Here\'s how I would describe what an algorithm is in as simple of a way as possible: An algorithm is a recipe. Like a recipe, an algorithm is a set of instructions that one follows to obtain a result of a desired form. You can now tell people to ""let me cook"" when you solve a problem with an algorithm.\nWhy is it important to know how to think algorithmically? I believe that it lies in an algorithm\'s ability to solve a big problem with small steps. Sometimes we are faced with a complex problem where we can\'t see the direct line of reasoning right away. Being able to think algorithmically, in small steps, allows us to break down the complexity of the problem and tackle it in smaller chunks. Coding helps us learn how to think algorithmically because giving a computer instructions to follow is essentially giving it an algorithm. When we understand how to code a solution to a problem, it also allows us to understand its solution from an algorithmic perspective. Thinking like a computer is not always a good thing, but it can be in the right scenarios.\nModern Times Call for Skills in Coding\nComputers are an essential part of our everyday lives, whether people want to admit it or not. They specifically help math majors in more than a couple of ways, including visualizations, quick calculations, and covering up our horrible handwriting with LaTeX. Learning how to code and be able to translate your work from paper to computer is a very valuable tool. This is especially true in research, where simulations, modeling, and visualizations are key.\nI don\'t want to sit here and be cliche and say ""The times are changing and to keep up, you have to learn how to code"", but that\'s essentially what I\'m trying to say. If you think about it, cursive writing is still taught in school and yet coding is probably a much more useful and widely used skill than cursive. I\'ve been thinking about this for a while, and I cannot think of a quantitative field where it would be detrimental or nonessential for them to know how to code. Not only will you save yourself the pain of having to learn it later when you\'re not in school, but being able to list coding as part of your skillset can open many opportunities and projects for you.\nIt\'s Fun (Sometimes)\nThis one is controversial (not really)! One good thing coming from how quickly the tech world is evolving is that it shows the world how powerful coding and computers can be when you wield their strengths correctly. Some really interesting AND fun projects can be accomplished with coding. If you\'re really into music and curating Spotify playlists, a good understanding of linear algebra and programming can let you build a project that analyzes your music taste and comes up with some pretty hilarious characterizations (I\'m talking about those out-of-pocket daylist titles). If you\'re into sports, consider learning some data science and building a project that\'ll predict the next MVP of the NBA season. There\'s a project out there for nearly every hobby.\nIn Conclusion\nCoding can be an extreme pain sometimes. We aren\'t computers, so we sometimes have difficulty understanding why they can\'t understand our instructions the way we do. However, when we actually get our programs to work, it\'s the most fulfilling feeling ever. Math is the foundation, the language, of all sciences. With our ever-evolving world, science is starting to adopt another language, computer programming. It\'s important that we recognize this and add coding to our repertoire.\nHow can math majors start learning how to program? Unfortunately, Math 124, the class designed for this exact purpose, isn\'t being offered next year. However, if you\'re going to be at Berkeley for longer than a year, I would definitely keep my eyes out for this class. I\'m currently enrolled in this class and I do believe it\'s an extremely useful class that challenges you and helps you grow as a programmer in the math tradition. So, a Berkeley math class might be out of the question, but there\'s other ways to start learning how to code, whether it be a different department\'s class like Data 8 or picking up a textbook and learning yourself. Coding education has also become very accessible through platforms like Codeacademy. If you\'d like to learn more about this or have any questions about how to get started, please feel free to send the Peer Advisors an email or drop in during my office hours on Mondays 12-1pm.\nThat\'s all the yapping I will do for this week. If you\'ve made it this far in the blog, thank you. I really appreciate all the support that the Peer Advising team receives. Please stay on the lookout for more events and updates through our Instagram! Please also check the peer advising website for our email and weekly office hours. Stay healthy, and take care of yourselves.\n~ Daniel']","['data:image/svg+xml;base64,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']",FALSE,None,08-Mar-2024,10:41 PM,None,FALSE,None

Everybody needs time off, and it won’t do you any good to burn out right before RRR week.

I also recommend really taking the time to focus on learning the material if there are any gaps in your knowledge. Sometimes during the rush of the semester we get caught up in completing assignments that we forget to truly learn the material.

With Phase 1 of Spring 2024 enrollment starting, a lot of students are ready to move on from this semester and put it behind them (and I don't blame them). However, with nearly 6 weeks left of the semester, it's too early to check out. For my first Ed blog of the semester, I'd like to share how to stay locked in and regain motivation to finish this semester strong.\n1. Assess Where You Are\nThroughout the semester, we battle what feels like a constant flurry of homework, exams, projects, and random labs you forget are due on Tuesdays (maybe that last one is just me). We get so caught up with staying afloat and focusing on the imminent deadlines that we lose sight of the big picture. Start by finding out where you are in your class. Are you ahead of schedule, just caught up, or falling behind on content? Knowing where you stand is the first step toward a focused endgame for the semester.\nExample: I'll share my Math 104 experience this semester. I'm feeling pretty caught up in lectures and content, but I missed a couple of important lectures on continuity a couple of weeks ago. It's one of my priorities to revisit these lectures on my own time to make sure that it doesn't become a hole in my understanding.\n2. Schedule Your Deadlines\nWe want to refocus ourselves on the bigger picture instead of getting caught up on the small weekly tasks. An important part of this is being aware of deadlines (especially exam dates). With the second wave of midterms just around the corner (or already passing), scheduling out important dates for your class will give you a much clearer picture of the rest of the semester. Remember that syllabus you were supposed to read at the beginning of the summer but briefly skimmed over? It's probably time to revisit that.\nExample: I know that across all my classes, I have two more midterms for the semester, which conveniently (or not) are back-to-back next week. In terms of projects, I have two more projects before the end of the semester. These are the big deadlines that I keep in mind as I plan out the rest of my semester. I want to plan around these dates to have sufficient time to review.\n3. Review Your Goals\nWhen refocusing, it's important to not only look ahead but look behind as well. Ask yourself honestly how the semester has gone so far. Have things been under control or out of control? Whether or not you made goals at the beginning of the semester, have you been satisfied with what you've accomplished this semester? Remember, there's still a significant portion of the semester left, so it's definitely not too late to set goals and go after them. Reminding yourself of your goals, creating new ones, and setting yourself on the path to achieving them are great ways of refocusing and revitalizing your motivation for the current semester.\nExample: I've been pretty checked out of one of my classes on probability. However, one of my goals this semester was to take very detailed and neat notes on this class to save for later and potentially include in my portfolio. I recently started to go back and review older lectures and rewrite them into neater note styles. \nConclusion\nMost importantly, make time for yourself. University life is NOT easy, especially during this time of the semester. Refresh your mindset with a restful weekend or a fun event. Take care of yourself both physically (please get your booster shot and your flu shot) and mentally. \nWhile the semester may seem to be coming to a close with enrollment in session and a final round of midterms rolling around, there's still a lot of school left to go. Let's take the right steps towards ending the semester on a good note.\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading my first blog post of the semester! I hope you're able to take something away from this, or even share your own thoughts about this topic in the thread. As always, please feel free to come in during office hours (thread #180) or shoot us an email to talk about anything we can help you with. Best of luck with the rest of the semester!\n~ Daniel\np.s.

Just a quick reminder that there are NO office hours next week due to finals, but you are more than happy to email us with any questions that you have. This will be our final blog of the semester, so we just want to thank everyone who\'s read these blogs over the semester and supported our team in all various ways. We really appreciate all the support and we\'re going to come back next semester with more events, content, and (of course) advising.\nToday\'s topic is something that I think we all feel at some point in the semester, but it feels the absolute worst when it hits right before exam season. Burnout is when one has overexerted themselves mentally and physically to the point where they feel demotivated to accomplish anything that they need to do. Sound familiar? It\'s been a really long semester with lots of obstacles, but we\'re almost at the finish line! Today, I\'m going to share some pieces of advice that will hopefully help you stay strong and locked in to make it to that finish line.\n1. Plan beforehand how you\'re going to approach your study time.\nThis seems a bit late to implement now, but it\'s actually never too late to have a productive study session. When you plan out what exactly you want to study, what topics you want to hit, and for how long you want to study, it streamlines your study time and gets rid of that unproductive time when you\'re thinking about what to study next. When someone goes to the gym, they\'ll be a lot more efficient with their time if they know their workout (what machines they want to use, their sets, etc). Similarly, we want to be efficient with our time by pre-planning our study sessions before we hit the ""gym"" (your room, a library, a cafe). A lot of burnout is a result of feeling like a single task is taking way too long. When we\'re more efficient with our study time, it\'ll lead to us feeling like we\'ve gotten more done within less time, thus reducing burnout. \nEx. Let\'s say I want to study both Math 113 and CS 170 today. I\'m going to plan to hit Math 113 for 2 hours, and then CS 170 for 3 hours. For the two hours of Math 113, I\'ll spend the first hour reviewing Chapter 5 (Fields) and the second hour going through the Final Review. At this point, I can take a break for food or whatever I want. For the first hour of CS 170, I\'ll review the final section (Approximating Algorithms). In the second hour, I\'ll read through the review slides from the review sessions. I can take another (smaller) break at this point. Afterward, I\'ll work through 1 or 2 previous finals for my final hour of CS 170. \n2. Integrate break time and rest time into your study schedule.\nThis is something that I still struggle with. Rest is SO IMPORTANT to studying. Not only are you giving yourself a break from intense studying (which can be stressful), but you\'re giving your mind time to digest what you\'ve studied and create connections between what you\'ve learned. Rather than saying you\'ll take a break when you\'re all done with studying, try and take a break at a nice checkpoint in your studying (lunchtime, dinnertime, end of a chapter, etc). You\'ll see that you can study for a longer time with more productivity when you put breaks into your study schedule. \nEx. I want to study for at least 5 hours today. I can implement breaks in two ways. Either, I can hit larger chunks of studying (like the first example that I described), or I can integrate smaller breaks at a higher frequency. For example, instead of taking a long break after every two hours, I can take a 15-minute break after every 45 minutes of studying (sound familiar?). Either of these strategies is valid and it\'s up to the preference of the student.\n3. Find a form of motivation that will keep you locked in.\nThis piece of advice is very generalized, but I think it\'s worth mentioning. Sometimes, finding something that is inspiring or motivating can really help you push through a stressful time. Rather than trying to explain it in general, I will share an example.\nEx. I\'m a huge Golden State Warriors fan. Right now, the Warriors are competing against the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals of the NBA Playoffs. It\'s a really stressful and competitive time for these teams. However, my team is still going out every game and putting on a show. We can\'t even see the extent of their practice, but we can only imagine how much work they\'re putting in to perform at such a high level on a high-stakes stage. To me, this is extremely inspiring. I\'ve been telling myself this week, ""If Steph Curry is getting to work, I should get to work too"". Of course, we\'re students at UC Berkeley and Steph is the best shooter to ever touch a basketball, so there\'s a bit of adjustment when it comes to what ""work"" looks like. However, it\'s the spirit and motivation that matters, and seeing my team put in the work to perform makes me want to put in the work so I can perform during finals week. This can apply to anything you want to think about, it doesn\'t have to be about an athlete that you admire. Motivation could come from looking forward to your fun summer trip with friends or that Twice concert that you just can\'t wait to go to in June. Regardless, it\'s really helpful to find something to look forward to or look up to.\n4. A change in scenery\nThe final piece of advice! Don\'t stay stuck in one single room while you\'re studying, even if it is your favorite place to study. A nice change in environment will force you to go outside and t̶o̶u̶c̶h̶ ̶g̶r̶a̶s̶s̶ get some fresh air. It\'ll also force you to keep better track of time instead of letting the hours fly away from you. Are you always studying at Moffitt? Perhaps choose to study in the East Asian Library next time or the Music Library or even the study room in the Physics building (I just learned about this space yesterday). The important thing is that you\'re actively choosing a different place to study, which can help you stay focused and stay locked in. Staring at something else than your usual wall or ceiling can really help turn those brain cogs. \nConclusion\nBurnout and feeling demotivated suck. It\'s also really difficult to avoid at times, considering how academically rigorous and busy Berkeley can be. That is why it\'s crucial to find ways to combat it. Plan ahead, give yourself rest, rediscover motivation, and consider switching up your study environment. I hope these pointers can make your study sessions for finals more effective, but also easier for you.\nThat\'s all for this blog! I want to thank you all again for your support on these blogs and everything else that the Math Peer Advising team does. Huge shoutout to our head advisor Hanh for being a great leader of our team this semester, and congrats to our seniors Vanessa and Sophia as they graduate and move onto the workplace!\nBest of luck to you all on finals!

For those of you who haven't taken the class, here are some fun things to look forward to:\nAbstract algebra, the topic covered in 113m is a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. It is a fascinating field of study that has applications in many different areas of mathematics and beyond. In this blog post, we will introduce some interesting concepts in abstract algebra that are both important and useful.\nGroup Theory\nGroup theory is one of the central concepts in abstract algebra. A group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse. The binary operation is usually denoted by a multiplication symbol, but it need not be actual multiplication. The elements of a group can be anything, as long as the four properties hold.\nGroups are used to study symmetry, and they have applications in physics, chemistry, and computer science. For example, the Rubik's cube can be understood as a group of permutations, where each turn corresponds to a different permutation of the cube's pieces. Group theory is also used in cryptography to ensure the security of communications.\nRing Theory\nRing theory is another important concept in abstract algebra. A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication. The addition operation satisfies the usual properties of addition, such as commutativity and associativity, while the multiplication operation satisfies the distributive property.\nRings are used to study algebraic structures that are not groups. For example, the set of integers is a ring, but it is not a group under multiplication. Ring theory has applications in number theory, coding theory, and cryptography.\nField Theory\nField theory is a more advanced concept in abstract algebra. A field is a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication, such that the set is a commutative ring under both operations and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.\nFields are used to study algebraic structures that are not rings. For example, the set of real numbers is a field, but the set of integers is not. Field theory has applications in algebraic geometry, number theory, and cryptography.""]",[None],FALSE,None,20-Apr-2023,05:48 PM,None,FALSE,None

I hope everyone had a good Valentine's day. In the spirit of love, here are some ideas for how to romanticize the math major (or how to stay motivated). Obviously these might not all work for everyone, but hopefully they can be a starting point if you’re feeling unmotivated. \nGo to libraries\nStudying in a beautiful library, or the Evans library, always makes me feel more productive and helps me get into the flow of working. The important part is getting out of your room. Studying for hours at a time in your room can feel isolating and decrease your motivation. A change of environment can help you start thinking differently, and some people find being surrounded by others who are working hard can motivate them to work hard as well.\nExercise\nExercise, even in the form of a walk or stretching, can provide your brain with a much needed break, and can re-energize you for some more studying afterwards. It doesn’t have to be a time consuming activity, just get your body moving for a few minutes every so often and avoid long stretches of being completely sedentary if you’re able to. \nGo to lecture\nI personally really enjoy going to lecture and find myself a lot more motivated to do problems if I see the topics introduced in class. Especially if you get behind in a class, going to lecture at least ensures that you’re being introduced to the current topics \nStudy with a friend/in a group\nWorking with other people is fun and a good way to make sure you understand the content, since you’ll have to explain your reasoning to other people. It’s also just nice to be able to talk about something that you like with other people who share experiences with you. \nSome other quick ideas:\nWrite on a whiteboard or chalkboard instead of on paper\nDo a bit of math reading outside of class, remind yourself what else is out there\nWatch Good Will Hunting - remind yourself that other people think math is cool too\nGet involved!

Here I’ll try to elaborate on what this means for those of you who haven’t yet taken an upper division class and don’t know what to expect (or perhaps are taking your first right now). \nIn Math 1A (or high school), for instance, we learned several tricks for finding the limits of sequences or functions. Consider the sine function. You can easily tell it doesn’t converge by graphing it and noticing it oscillates up and down forever. But that’s just intuitive reasoning. How do we guarantee it doesn’t converge without a shred of a doubt? That’s the essential idea of a formal proof. (In this case, you would do a proof by contradiction.)\nYour 1A professor might have explained the epsilon definition of a limit and have you do a few problems related to it on your homework. But Math 104 (real analysis) is where this definition really comes alive. Epsilon and epsilon-delta definitions lay the groundwork for the class and starting from just these alone, you formally prove the key concepts you learned in 1A/B (limit properties, differentiation rules, properties of functions, to name a few). \nThere are analogues of this. 110 (linear algebra) is the formal followup to 54, for instance. Not all upper division classes are entirely proof-based, but most of them do have proofs as a necessary component. \nThe key takeaway is that the first few upper division classes you take will revisit many things you’ve already studied, but from a more formal perspective. After taking those and being exposed to basic proof-writing techniques, you’ll move on to other classes that teach you new things that cannot be taught at the lower division level - 113 (abstract algebra), for example.\nI hope this was helpful in giving you a conceptual idea of what upper division classes look like.

Some people have already learned most of the content of a core class, but still need to take it for credit. It might be fun to go above and beyond in your learning, if you have to take the class anyway. Other people are interested in having a smaller class, maybe with more professorial interaction. Another factor some consider is that the homeworks might have fewer, harder problems, and they prefer that.\nIn general, not all honors classes are ""honors"" in the same way - some may not deviate tmuch from the standard class syllabus, but have higher expectations in terms of assignments and exams. Others may go into some bonus topics, especially ones of interest to the professor who\'s teaching. Some honors classes cover quite different material from what is taught in the standard version of the class. Given this variability, it\'s a good idea to have a backup plan if you find you don\'t like the style of your honors class before the add/drop deadline.\nMy personal experience with honors classes has been quite good. They were hard, but not categorically harder than other upper divs I\'ve taken. I took honors classes for fields I was especially interested in, which definitely made the added difficulty less of a burden. I especially loved seeing some nonstandard material that introduced me to fields of math I would otherwise have only seen a lot later in my undergrad career.\nI want to conclude with a word of caution. So far, I\'ve basically only said good things about honors classes. But at a school like Berkeley, probably most of us were used to going for the biggest challenges available to us before we came here. At Berkeley, that just isn\'t sustainable - or we\'d all be taking schedules of exclusively graduate special topics classes! It\'s important to check yourself when you have thoughts like ""I have to take the honors version of everything, or I\'m not trying hard enough."" Lots of great professors teach very worthwhile and challenging non-honors sections of the core classes. Ask yourself what matters more at the end of the day: a positive experience in a class where you feel confident and de-stressed enough to personally engage with the material, or an extra letter on your transcript?\nTl;dr honors classes can be fun, although they vary a lot by professor, but try not to push yourself into doing them if it doesn\'t work for you or ends up stressing you out.']",[None],FALSE,None,08-Nov-2022,11:45 PM,None,FALSE,None

The numbers 1–4 are not congruent numbers, but 5, 6 and 7 all are congruent numbers. These numbers appear in Fibonacci\'s book ""Liber Quadratorum (book of squares)"" and were studied by Lagrange, Fermat and others. Determining the set of congruent numbers amounts to identifying elliptic curves of a certain type that have positive rank. The conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer translates the identification problem into an analytic problem involving L-series of elliptic curves. I will explain how the main themes in this story fit together and point to some ongoing research about elliptic curves and their L-series. Although Fibonacci numbers appear prominently in Math 55, I had little idea about Fibonacci himself until I encountered his Book of Squares.

One of the major challenges in the field is developing the tools to ensure this new technology is safe for patients. The main roadblock to our current therapeutic pipeline is the inability to detect potential genomic off targets throughout the genome because the methodologies and pipelines for high-throughput whole genome analysis don't exist in a cohesive form. Together, our Data Sci Discovery project will work to: 1) understand existing whole genome sequencing analysis pipelines, 2) understand genetic changes after CRISPR editing, 3) build software to create a new pipeline for whole genome CRISPR off-target analysis for research and clinical use. Our team will be 1-3 students with a background in Computer Science, Dr. Clelland, and two former Data Sci Discovery Berkeley students, Patrick Issagohlian-Lewin (2023 DS Insights Award winner) and Tanya Jain. Knowledge of genomics/molecular biology a plus, but not required. We will teach you about genetics!
